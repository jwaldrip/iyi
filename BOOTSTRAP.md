# The bootstrap contract

What it would take for iyi to compile itself, what each stage has to prove
before the next one starts, and what is still linked when it is done.

Every number here is measured from this tree by `python3 bench/doc_numbers.py`
and `bash bench/dependency_floor.sh`, not estimated.

## Where this actually stands

`src/compiler` is **110,105 lines of Crystal and 41,496 lines of iyi**. The
iyi side is the lexer, the token, the AST, the visitor and transformer, the
parser's expressions and declarations, the normalizer, the top-level declaration
and expression and method body typing passes of semantic analysis, the type
system (unification, generics, virtual types, nilable handling, restrictions,
narrowing, and rendering), the artifact format, the bind tool, the command
driver and build daemon, the formatter, the macro engine, platform support
(targets, flags, and linker commands), the four foundation files, the LLVM
bindings, and the first slice of code generation:

### Prelude Compilation Status (Hole 3)

The prelude compilation gate (`bench/selfhost_prelude_exercise.sh`) tracks the highest compiler phase reached by each of the 17 prelude files in `src/iyi/*.iyi`:

| File | Lines | Phase Reached | Current Blocker / Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `array.iyi` | 507 | link | Reaches link on pure-iyi raise runtime |
| `atomic.iyi` | 89 | link | Reaches link on pure-iyi raise runtime |
| `concurrency.iyi` | 1946 | link | Reaches link on pure-iyi raise runtime |
| `enum.iyi` | 161 | link | Reaches link on pure-iyi raise runtime |
| `file.iyi` | 65 | link | Reaches link on pure-iyi raise runtime |
| `float.iyi` | 718 | link | Reaches link on pure-iyi raise runtime |

The bind gate is now a real parity gate against the shipped `Iyi.print_bind`
over a corpus the shipped tool can analyse. The oracle consumes a semantically
analysed program. The five original parser fixtures were syntax exercises rather
than valid programs, rejected semantically by the shipped compiler (a `class < self`
superclass, `fun redefinition with different signature` in a `lib` block,
`include self` on a class, a trait requiring a generic module, and top-level
ivars). Rather than trimming the corpus, five companion fixtures
(`bind_classes_and_structs`, `bind_lib_and_fun`, `bind_modules_and_inclusion`,
`bind_traits_and_impls`, `bind_types_and_vars`) cover the exact same declaration
surface as programs the shipped compiler accepts. All eleven fixtures in the
corpus bind identically (28 public methods), and all eight mutation proofs are
caught.

What is **not** in iyi: semantic analysis beyond the top-level declaration,
expression and method body typing passes, instance and class variable type
inference, recursive struct check, overload resolution, multiple dispatch,
and block and closure type inference (first-class captured proc values and
exception handling typing),
TypeNode inspection in macros, and codegen beyond the fun, struct, class,
virtual dispatch, nilable, block inlining, exception, proc closure, string literal,
user-defined generic instantiation, heap layout, and runtime symbol declaration slices (and the GC interface). That is the
109,871. The formatter, macro engine and codegen are partly ported, and their
rows above say which parts are not.
Before this change, nothing in the build called any of the ports above: each
was checked against the code it would replace, not used in its place. Three
wiring steps are now active: `iyi mod dump --selfhost` routes artifact inspection
through the pure iyi port (`src/compiler/tools/mod.iyi` and
`src/compiler/artifact/iyimod.iyi`), proved byte-identical across the entire
module corpus by `bench/selfhost_mod_wiring_exercise.sh`;
`iyi tool format --selfhost` routes source code formatting through the pure iyi
port (`src/compiler/tools/format.iyi` and `src/compiler/tools/formatter.iyi`),
proved byte-identical across all 35 corpus files by
`bench/selfhost_format_wiring_exercise.sh`; and
`iyi check --parse-only --selfhost` routes source code syntax checking through
the pure iyi port (`src/compiler/tools/parse.iyi` and `src/compiler/syntax/parser.iyi`),
proved byte-identical across 68 corpus files and 5 refusal scenarios by
`bench/selfhost_parser_wiring_exercise.sh`.
The artifact row proves binary parity: 16 modules across `samples/iyi` and
`src/std` (80,414 bytes) produce byte-identical `.iyimod` files between Crystal
and iyi, each implementation cross-reads what the other wrote with identical
dumps, and damaged or corrupted artifacts are refused by both with identical
verdicts. What this gate does not prove on its own is standalone artifact
emission from un-analyzed user source code: extracting exported signatures,
type definitions, and layout pointer maps requires semantic analysis and the
type checker, which remain in Crystal. Once semantic analysis lands in iyi,
the artifact writer can be plugged directly into the front-end AST walk.

The parser is the one thing in between. Expressions and declarations are
ported, 5,130 lines of iyi against the 7,384 of
`src/compiler/iyi/syntax/parser.cr`, and `bench/selfhost_parser_exercise.sh`
requires every one of twenty-five syntax fixtures to produce a normalised tree
identical to the frontend's, 1,677 nodes in all. Declarations here means `def`
in its argument and return-type forms, `class`, `struct`, `module`, `enum`,
`trait`, `impl` with `forall`, `annotation`, `lib` and `fun`, type and
variable declarations, `alias`, inclusion, visibility, and macro control grammar
(`{% if %}`, `{% elsif %}`, `{% else %}`, `{% unless %}`, `{% for %}`, `{% begin %}`,
`{% verbatim %}`, and `{{ ... }}`).

Macro control grammar modes are parsed and lexed by the pure iyi front end,
supported by `next_macro_token` in `syntax/lexer.iyi`.

## The stages

Stage zero is the contract, not a build. It is the set of statements a later
stage is measured against, so that "it bootstrapped" is a checkable claim
rather than a feeling.

**Stage 0, the contract.** No compiler is built. What has to be true:

1. Every iyi file under `src/compiler` compiles with the current compiler and
   is exercised by a gate that carries a failure proof. True today for all five
   groups above.
2. A stage-one compiler is built *by Crystal* from iyi sources. Its output is
   the thing under test, never its own source.
3. A stage-two compiler is built *by stage one* from the same sources.
4. Stage two is byte-identical to a stage-three built by stage two. That is the
   fixed point, and it is the only evidence that accepts the compiler as
   self-describing. Stage one and stage two are NOT expected to be identical:
   they were produced by different compilers.
5. The reproduction is measured with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` pinned and the
   artifact paths normalised, because otherwise the comparison proves the
   filesystem rather than the compiler.

**Stage 1.** Crystal compiles iyi sources into a compiler. Blocked on the ten
components listed above being written in iyi. This is the long pole and it is
not close: 109,871 lines of it.

**Stage 2.** Stage one compiles the same sources. The first moment iyi is
written in iyi.

**Stage 3.** Stage two compiles the same sources. `cmp` stage two against
stage three. Equal is the pass.

## What is still linked when this is done

This is the part worth being plain about, because "self-hosted" is often heard
as "dependency free" and it is not the same claim.

A self-hosted iyi compiler still links:

- **libLLVM**, and **libstdc++** with it. `src/compiler/llvm/lib_llvm.iyi:11`
  carries `@[Link("stdc++")]` and the LLVM ldflags. The bindings being written
  in iyi changes who calls LLVM, not whether LLVM is there.
- **the platform libc**, which is the floor for any program on a supported
  target and is Apple's only supported interface on darwin.

What it stops linking is **libgc**: the collector is iyi's own, and a program
iyi builds already links no collector unless `-Dgc_boehm` asks for one. The
compiler links libgc today only because it is a Crystal program and Crystal's
runtime is built on Boehm.

So the honest end state of this work is: **a compiler that needs LLVM and a
libc.** Removing LLVM is a separate decision about a native back end, and
nothing here assumes it.

## What would make this contract false

Each of these is a way the claim could read as satisfied while being wrong, so
each one is a gate or it is not being checked:

- A stage-two build that reuses stage one's artifacts rather than recompiling.
  The reproduction must start from a clean artifact directory.
- Comparing stage one against stage two and calling it a fixed point. It is
  not; they had different producers.
- A byte comparison that passes because both binaries embed the same timestamp
  path rather than the same code.
- `src/compiler/*.iyi` growing a file no gate exercises. The five groups above
  each have one; a sixth needs one in the same commit.
