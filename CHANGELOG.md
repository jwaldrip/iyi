# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **`samples/iyi/calc`: a language, in the language.** Three modules — a
  scanner, a parser and an evaluator — reading a program from standard input,
  written against iyi's own 1,184-line library and nothing else. Every other
  sample is a page long, and a language that has only been used for pages has
  not been used.

  It grew the prelude by exactly what it asked for, which is the rule the
  prelude grows by: `String#[]`, `String#[](start, count)`, `String#to_i` and
  `read_input`. Nothing else was missing. `/` was not added, and that is the
  interesting one: iyi has no floats, Crystal's `/` on integers returns a
  `Float64`, and a name that means two things is what III.1.7a settled against
  — so integer division stays `//` in both.

### Changed

- **A module path is read from the root, not from where it is written.** A
  module called `samples/calc` importing `calc/lexer` resolved `Calc` to
  itself, then said the module was not imported: a true-looking sentence about
  the wrong thing. A module's path is its file's path (R-1), so it cannot mean
  something different depending on where it appears. Found by writing the
  sample above, which is called `calc`.

- **`Array#sort` is `sort_in_place`, and `sorted` is the copy.** A plain `sort`
  meant the opposite thing in the two libraries — it sorted the array under
  iyi's and returned a copy under Crystal's — with no error either way, which
  is the worst shape a difference can take. The plain verb is not in this
  library now, so the same call is an error under one and Crystal's meaning
  under the other.

  Measured before deciding: of everything iyi's library mutates — `<<`, `[]=`,
  `concat`, `shift`, `sort` — only `sort` disagreed, because Crystal writes `!`
  on the mutating member of a *pair* and plainly for the rest. One method
  today, and the shape every future pair would have had. SPEC.md III.1.7a has
  the three options that were on the table.

  The error teaches the rule: a missing name whose participle exists says so,
  which the suggestion machinery could not — `sort` to `sorted` is two edits.

Master is `0.3.0-dev`. Under the artifact rule 0.2.0 introduced, that means
every build of it interoperates with nothing but itself: a version between two
releases names no compiler, so it cannot be handed one released artifact and
told they match.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-20

**A program chooses its library.** 0.1.0 had one, 1,184 lines of it, and that
was most of what stood between the language and anybody's real program. It
turned out not to be a library problem: a prelude is a library and the rules
are the language, so a program can keep one and change the other. `--crystal`
does, and there `require` means what it means in Crystal. Nine shards were
swept through it and a Kemal server written in iyi serves HTTP; how many of the
rest work is not something this release measured.

Two more entries take the rules further out — `pub` reaches a macro and a
constant — and closing each found the same hole underneath: a surface nobody
wrote and nobody could refuse.

Artifacts written by this release are read by every other build of it, on the
same target and under the same flags. A `-dev` version between two releases
names no compiler and interoperates with nothing but itself, which is the rule
below doing its job rather than an exception to it.

### Changed

- **The tarball carries Crystal's library, so `--crystal` works in what people
  download.** It shipped iyi's own 56 KB and nothing else, so the release's
  headline feature answered `require "json"` with "can't find file" outside a
  checkout. It ships both now — 13.4 MB to 14.9 MB — and CI runs a `--crystal`
  program out of the unpacked tarball, which is where this was found and where
  it would have been found again.

- **`make cli_spec` says once when the daemon and the compiler are different
  builds.** The daemon refuses a client built from another compiler, correctly
  — it holds an analysed prelude — but the spec saw that as nine failures, each
  printing two version strings, with the reason in none of them. It is easy to
  arrive at, too: the build commit comes from git HEAD while make compares file
  times, so a commit can leave two binaries disagreeing about a commit while
  agreeing about every line of code.

- **`iyi mod diff` says whether a change reaches a module's consumers.** The
  three hashes an artifact carries already answered it and nothing asked them.
  It compares two `.iyimod` files, says which of interface, implementation and
  source moved — with what each of the three means, because the middle one is
  the surprising one — and names the exports that came and went when the
  interface is what moved. `--exit-code` exits 1 in that case, which is
  `git diff`'s spelling and its reason: the answer is not a failure.

- **An iyi program is run on three targets every build, not one.** It compiled
  for eight and was tested on one, which is a weak thing to call portability.
  CI now cross-compiles `hello.iyi` for musl and for aarch64, links each with
  the target's own `cc` and `libgc` — the command `--cross-compile` prints —
  and runs them: in an Alpine container and under emulation. The check is that
  each prints what the same program printed on the machine that compiled it.

- **`bench/runtime.py` measures what the library costs at run time.** The two
  libraries are within noise where they do the same work; `Hash` is 6x ahead
  and does less; `String` is 1.64x behind. The first reading said string
  building was twenty times faster, and it was the collector — a 17 KB binary
  has fewer roots to scan than a 972 KB one — so the bench reports both columns
  and the honest one is the second.

- **iyi describes itself as its own language, compatible with Crystal.** "A
  language built for Developer & Agentic Experience, Portability, Performance,
  and Efficiency", and README says what stands behind each of the four and what
  does not: the edit loop and the artifact are built, portability means eight
  targets that compile and one that is tested, the run-time measurement is new
  and says the two libraries are within noise where they do the same work, and
  the agentic claim is a mechanism rather than a result.

  Compatibility is stated as something checkable and in one direction: the same
  compiler builds `.cr` files, an iyi program can `require` a shard with
  `--crystal`, and a Crystal program cannot require an iyi module, because R-2's
  written types and R-3's closed types are what an artifact is made of.

  `iyi version` reads `iyi 0.2.0-dev (built on Crystal 1.22.0-dev …)`: the
  language first and what it is built on after. The licence and NOTICE.md are
  unchanged, because Apache 2.0's attribution is an obligation rather than a
  description.

- **An artifact is read by the release that wrote it, not by the build.** A
  `.iyimod` was locked to the exact compiler build, commit and all, so two
  builds of the same version refused each other's modules and handing one to
  somebody meant handing them your compiler too. The identity is now the
  released version, the target and the flags: every build of iyi 0.1.0 reads
  every other build's artifacts on the same target under the same flags. A
  `-dev` version keeps the commit, because it names no release. The version
  comes from `src/IYI_VERSION`, which is also what the binary reports and what
  the tarball is named after.

### Added

- **`iyi build --crystal` compiles a program against Crystal's standard
  library, so `require` reaches the ecosystem.** A `.iyi` file refused
  `require` because there was nothing to require: the prelude is what a program
  gets. That reason stops being true when the prelude is Crystal's. The rules
  do not change with the library — the module header, `pub`, `import`, `using`,
  traits and `impl` are all still there, and a shard is ordinary Crystal
  compiled into the program.

  A Kemal server written this way serves HTTP. What it gives up is R-1 for that
  dependency: the shard is read from source, so the edit loop pays for it the
  way Crystal does. Your own modules are unaffected, and `--emit-iyimod` still
  writes them.

  `crystal tool bind` writes what it generates with `--emit-bind`, its own
  switch, because what it writes is a boundary for a shard rather than this
  build's own modules.

  The two libraries are two modes and do not mix on the artifact side:
  `--use-iyimod` and `--emit-iyimod` need iyi's own prelude. An artifact's
  object code numbers the types its module made, which under Crystal's library
  include the standard library's own, and a consumer compiling its own copy of
  that library has two of everything. That was an LLVM module which would not
  verify; it is a sentence now.

  **Nine shards were swept through it**, each built twice — as an iyi program
  and as a Crystal one, so that a difference is this fork's and a shared
  failure is the ecosystem's. `kemal`, `db`, `ameba`, `habitat`,
  `baked_file_system`, `radix`, `sqlite3`, the standard library's own
  `json`/`yaml`/`uri`/`http`, and a program that round-trips
  `JSON::Serializable` and writes a file. All nine behave the same in both
  languages. One needed a word changed and it was the rule working: `habitat`'s
  macro resolves the type it is handed by name, and a class an iyi module
  leaves unmarked is private, so it needs `pub class`.

  `samples/crystal/stdlib.iyi` is the program CI builds to keep this true: a
  trait with a default, an `impl` on a generic, an error union with `!` and
  `.or`, a `defer`, and JSON, YAML and URI in the same file.

- **`pub` takes a constant.** `pub LIMIT = 42` is reachable through the
  module's name; an unmarked constant is the module's own and is refused by the
  sentence an unmarked `def` gets. Nothing was added to the artifact format,
  because a module's top level already travels as source and the mark travels
  with it.

  The hole under it is the same one `pub macro` found: a constant's visibility
  was never set, so every constant a module declared was reachable. That is
  what a real shard leans on — Kemal hands out every object it has through one.

- **`pub macro`, so a macro can cross a module boundary.** Every macro a module
  writes already travelled in its artifact, because a body that travels may
  call one, but none of them was reachable: `pub` did not take a macro. A
  marked one is now reachable exactly as a `pub def` is, unqualified after
  `using` or through the module's name, and it works against an artifact with
  the module's source deleted. What it exports is a name and an arity, because
  a macro takes syntax and returns syntax.

  Two things worth knowing. Closing this found the hole under it: a macro's
  visibility was never set, so **every** module's macros were already callable
  through its name — that is refused now, with the sentence an unexported `def`
  gets. And macros are not hygienic, so a `pub macro` that writes `tmp = 99`
  assigns to the consumer's `tmp`; SPEC.md IV.4 says so in full.

- **`iyi tool format` formats iyi.** The formatter is Crystal's and knew none
  of iyi's syntax, so a module header, a `pub`, a `trait`, an `impl`, a
  `using`, a bounded `forall`, a `where`, a `defer`, a `!` or an `.or` sent it
  into "there's a bug formatting this file". It knows all of them now, and a
  directory is searched for `.iyi` files as well as `.cr` ones. The prelude and
  the nine samples format to themselves, which is the test that made the last
  three of those show up.

### Fixed

- **A generic imported from an artifact links again when its type argument is
  inferred.** `Box(Int32).new(42)` always worked and `Box.new(42)` did not.
  Inference makes `new` a method on `Box(T)`, which is the artifact's own type,
  and the rule that says "this type's machine code is in the artifact" was
  reading the generic itself. An artifact carries a unit for every non-generic
  type a module declares and none for a generic one, because a generic has
  machine code only once somebody picks its arguments, and the consumer is who
  picks them. So the consumer declared a `new` that nothing defined and the
  program failed to link, saying `undefined reference to Box(T)::new<Int32>`.
  The consumer's rule now matches the producer's. Reported after 0.1.0 went
  out.

- **`Array#sort` sorts the array, and `sorted` hands back a copy.** SPEC.md
  III.1.7(A) settled that pair — the plain verb mutates, the participle copies,
  Swift's convention adopted because `!` had to leave identifiers so postfix
  `!` could propagate an error — and the prelude did not implement it: `sort`
  returned a copy and nothing mutated. It does now, and `sorted` is one line
  over it.

  Worth knowing when moving between the two libraries: Crystal names the same
  pair `sort!` and `sort`, so `a.sort` copies there and sorts here. It is the
  one call in this prelude that means something different under `--crystal`,
  and the note is in `src/iyi/array.iyi` where somebody is standing when it
  matters.

- **A `using` that cannot deliver is refused where it is written.** A module
  header makes a type, and inside it that name means the module — so
  `using app/count::{Tally}` in a module called `tally` asks for a name it
  cannot have. What it said before was that `Tally` was not
  `App::Count::Tally`, at the first line that used one, with nothing pointing
  at the directive. Found by writing a command-line program.

- **`String#size` counts when nobody counted.** Crystal reads `@length == 0` on
  a non-empty string as "not counted yet" and scans; this prelude returned the
  field. A string built by Crystal's own `to_json` therefore printed correctly
  through iyi's `puts` and answered `size` **0** — no error, a wrong number.
  Free for every string this prelude makes, because it fills the field. Found
  while measuring what crosses between the two languages.

- **A macro that cannot see a type says why.** An unresolved path stays a
  `Path`, so every method a macro would call on the type is undefined on that,
  and the message named `Path` rather than the type or the rule:
  `undefined macro method 'Path#constant'`. It now asks whether the path names
  a type that exists and is unexported, and says so when it does. Found by
  `habitat`.

- **The front end reads a `.iyi` file again.** Refusing `require` in a `.iyi`
  file spares the prelude's own, and the flag that says so was set in the
  driver but not in `crystal-front`, so the front-end binary refused the line
  it had just written itself. It is bench-only and ships in nothing.

- **A version bump takes effect.** `src/VERSION` and `src/IYI_VERSION` are
  compiled in with `read_file`, and the build did not depend on them, so
  changing the number changed nothing until something else did.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-18

The first release. There is nothing to compare it against, so this says what is
in it rather than what changed, and what a later version will have to keep
faith with.

### The language

Four rules, and everything else follows from them (SPEC.md):

- **R-1** A module is the unit of compilation. `import` forms a DAG, and
  compiling a module reads its imports' declarations, never their bodies.
- **R-2** Everything a module exports (`pub`) writes down full parameter and
  return types.
- **R-2b** `using` brings exported names into unqualified scope, written by the
  consumer.
- **R-3** No open classes. `impl Trait for Type` lives in the module that
  declares the trait or the one that declares the type.

Traits with defaults and associated types, generic impls with `forall`, errors
as ordinary union members with `!` propagation, `defer` scoped to the block,
and Crystal's syntax otherwise: union types, nil-safety, blocks, local
inference, macros.

### The artifact

`.iyimod` **format v19**. A module's declarations, its macros, the bodies that
have to travel, its object code, and a checksum per section. Artifacts are
version-locked: one written by another build of the compiler is refused and
rebuilt, never migrated, so a later version bumping this number is expected
rather than a breakage.

`iyi build --emit-iyimod DIR` writes them, `--use-iyimod DIR` builds against
them, and `iyi mod dump` prints one as text.

### The tool

`iyi` takes `build`, `run`, `mod`, `env`, `clear_cache`, `tool`, `version` and
`help`. `crystal` is the same compiler under its own name, and it still
compiles `.cr` files. `eval` is deliberately not on iyi's list: it has no
filename, so it gets Crystal's prelude and Crystal's rules, and a command that
answers in another language is worse than one that says where it went.

### Measured

One machine, release compiler, best of seven, seconds. A 30-module,
7,208-line project, rebuilt after changing one line in one module:

| | iyi | Crystal | `go build` |
|---|---|---|---|
| rebuild after one edit | **0.13** | 1.17 | 0.16 |

The same edit with every module read from source instead of from artifacts
costs 0.23 s, which is what R-1 is worth on this project. A full build of a
6,900-line program from scratch is 0.24 s against `go build`'s 0.09 s, which is
where iyi loses. `python3 bench/incremental.py` and `python3
bench/build_speed.py` print both, and refuse to time programs that do not agree
on their output.

### Not in this release

No IO beyond `puts`. No concurrency: SPEC.md III.4 specifies it and none of it
is built. No package manager, no standard library, no self-hosting. Linux
x86-64 only. `derive` macros do not cross modules. The prelude is 1,184 lines
and its collections are small, and `a[-1]` raises rather than indexing from the
end. The formatter is Crystal's and does not know iyi's syntax: `iyi tool
format` says so and leaves `.iyi` files alone.

### Provenance

A fork of [Crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal) at 1.22.0-dev,
Apache 2.0 with Swift exception, Copyright 2012-2026 Manas Technology
Solutions. The backend, the GC and the type checker are Crystal's work. The
compiler reports itself as `Crystal 1.22.0-dev` because that is what it is, and
it is bootstrapped by released Crystal 1.21.0, which is the version CI pins
and the one to install if you are building this from source.

Two bugs in Crystal's own compiler were found here and fixed in this fork; they
belong upstream and are separate commits for that reason:

- `Crystal.relative_filename` chopped the working directory off any path that
  merely began with its name, so a build in `/x/crystal` with a cache in
  `/x/crystal-cache` wrote its object files to `-cache/…`.
- The cache cleaner deleted the directory of a build that was still running,
  because it keeps the ten most recently modified directories and a build stops
  looking recent while its units sit in an optimization pass.
