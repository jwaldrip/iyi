# iyi: -Dwithout_iconv because iyi's String has no encoding conversion, so the
# compiler asks libiconv for nothing.
#
# -Dgc_none was not viable here for a long time, and the reason was never a
# collector. It was one byte. `String::Builder` grew its buffer to
# `real_bytesize + count` while `to_s` writes the string's terminator at
# `@buffer[real_bytesize]`, so a string whose final size landed exactly on its
# capacity had its terminator written one byte outside its allocation, and the
# reclaiming shrink was skipped because the capacity was not bigger than what
# was needed. bdw-gc rounds a block up and never reissues an address something
# still points at, so under the collector every program was correct. Plain
# `malloc` returns exactly the size asked for, and the next allocation
# overwrote the byte.
#
# What that looked like from outside: a 116-byte mangled function name in a
# 128-byte block, needing 129, clean at `target_def_fun` and corrupt at the
# same address by `check_mod_fun`, LLVM's `strlen` reading into the next
# allocation, and `samples/iyi/collections.iyi` failing to link 10 runs out of
# 10. Four mechanisms were written down before it and all four were wrong:
# invalid IR, a dropped symbol, an empty link line, and parallel codegen. The
# switch two lines below removes the parallel half and changed nothing, 5/5
# either way, which is what finally ruled threading out.
#
# Fixed in src/string/builder.cr, and measured: the same sample now builds 0
# failures in 10 runs with a fresh cache each, every sample builds, and the
# collector-free compiler links libLLVM and libSystem only. bench/collector_
# free_floor.sh is the gate, and it fails if the reservation is removed again.
#
# The compiler still builds with bdw-gc by default, and that is now a trade
# with numbers on it rather than a limit. Collector-free against default, zero
# failures in ten runs each: the 7,207-line generated project 598MB peak
# against 464MB, the compiler's own source 7,430MB against 5,702MB, wall time
# within noise both times. So it is 29% more peak memory for one fewer library
# on a binary whose floor already permits libc, and flipping this is a one-line
# change here whenever that is judged worth taking. What this note no longer
# says is that a collector is required: it is not, and the bug it was hiding
# was in the standard library the whole time.

# The collector choice, and it is deliberately not in COMPILER_FLAGS, because
# the shipped binary and the spec harness want opposite answers.
#
# `-Dgc_none` is the default because the objective is a compiler carrying no
# ancestor library, and `libgc` was the last one that was not a deliberate
# toolchain choice. `src/gc/none.cr` never frees, so peak memory is a function
# of how much a process allocates: a compiler invocation compiles one program
# and exits, measured at 598MB against 464MB on the 7,207-line project and
# 7,430MB against 5,702MB self-hosting.
#
# `compiler_spec` is the opposite shape. It compiles thousands of programs
# inside one long-lived process, and with no collector that process was
# `Killed` on CI, `Error 137`, which is the honest upper bound on an allocator
# that never frees rather than a bug. So the harness keeps bdw-gc and the
# binaries do not, which is the same split SPEC.md III.9 draws between the
# compiler and the programs it builds.
