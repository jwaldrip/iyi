# The Stage Two Contract

What stage two actually requires, the dependency order of the components,
the architectural holes that separate today's tree from a self-hosted compiler,
the first end-to-end compilation proof, and the observable that ends the objective.

Every number and claim in this document cites a measured file or command
output from this repository, verified by `python3 bench/doc_numbers.py`,
`bash bench/dependency_floor.sh`, and the selfhost exercise suite.

## 1. What Stage Two Is and the Objective Observable

`BOOTSTRAP.md` defines four bootstrapping stages:

* **Stage 0 (the contract):** No self-hosted compiler is built. The compiler
  is written in Crystal and compiled with Crystal (`bin/crystal`). The ported
  components are checked against the Crystal code they replace.
* **Stage 1 (the first compiler):** Crystal compiles the ported iyi compiler
  sources into an executable compiler binary.
* **Stage 2 (self-compilation):** Stage one compiles the same iyi sources.
  This is the first moment iyi is compiled by an iyi binary.
* **Stage 3 (fixed-point verification):** Stage two compiles the same sources,
  producing a stage three binary that is byte-for-byte identical (`cmp` pass).

### The Standing Objective

The standing objective of self-hosting is eliminating `libgc`. Running
`bash bench/dependency_floor.sh` confirms that user programs built by iyi link
only `libSystem.B.dylib` on macOS (the platform libc). However, `bin/iyi`
itself still links:

```
libc++.1.dylib libgc.1.dylib libLLVM.dylib libSystem.B.dylib
```

The compiler links `libgc` only because it is a Crystal program and Crystal's
runtime requires the Boehm garbage collector (`bdw-gc`). A self-hosted compiler
written in iyi uses iyi's own allocator and runtime (`src/iyi/prelude.iyi`),
which links no collector unless `-Dgc_boehm` asks for one.

The definitive observable that marks the close of this objective:

```
otool -L bin/iyi (on macOS) or readelf -d bin/iyi (on Linux)
```

shows only `libLLVM`, `libc++`, and the platform libc (`libSystem.B.dylib` on
macOS, `libc.so` on Linux), with `libgc` completely absent from the link line.

### The Heap Boundary Problem

`STAGE_ONE.md` recorded the primary architectural blocker as the heap boundary.
Crystal's compiler allocates all AST nodes, symbols, and types on the Boehm GC
heap. The ported iyi front end produces `ast.iyi` nodes on the iyi runtime heap.
Replacing a compiler pass in-process (for example, passing AST nodes from a pure
iyi parser directly into Crystal's semantic analyzer within the same process)
would require both the Boehm collector and the iyi allocator to coexist in one
process, managing intertwined data structures across foreign object headers.

Every component wired so far has respected this boundary by running as an
isolated companion process:

* `iyi mod dump --selfhost`: invokes `.build/iyi-mod` via process execution.
* `iyi tool format --selfhost`: invokes `.build/iyi-format` via process execution.
* `iyi check --parse-only --selfhost`: invokes `.build/iyi-parse` via process execution.
* `iyi-compile`: invokes `.build/iyi-compile` via standalone execution.

Stage Two moves past isolated companion tools to a whole-compiler replacement.
Because hybrid in-process execution is prohibited by the heap boundary, the
cutover must occur at the whole-compiler binary boundary: an executable binary
compiled from `src/compiler/**/*.iyi` that replaces `bin/iyi` entirely.

## 2. Measuring What Is Actually Left

As measured by `python3 bench/doc_numbers.py` and `git ls-files`, the compiler
source tree consists of:

* **110,105 lines of Crystal** across 114 files in `src/compiler/**/*.cr` and `src/compiler/*.cr`
* **39,650 lines of pure iyi** across 51 files in `src/compiler/**/*.iyi` and `src/compiler/*.iyi`

  variables, virtual hierarchy dispatch, pointers, exception landing pads, string literals
  with constant pool reuse, user-defined generic class and struct instantiations, heap layout

## 3. Can a Whole Compiler Be Assembled from the iyi Ports Alone Today?

Establishing with evidence: **No, a whole compiler cannot be assembled from the iyi ports alone today.**

The investigation identified six specific architectural holes that currently prevent
assembling a self-hosted compiler binary from `src/compiler/**/*.iyi` alone:

### Hole 1: Top-Level Compiler Pipeline Orchestrator
* **Status:** Closed.
* **Evidence:** `src/compiler/compiler.iyi` (278 lines) implements `Compiler` in pure iyi,
  orchestrating the full compilation pipeline: recursive import resolution, AST parsing,
  normalisation via `Normalizer`, semantic declaration extraction and type analysis,
  LLVM code generation across all modules, object file emission, and platform linking.
  `src/compiler/tools/compile.iyi` is refactored into a thin CLI wrapper calling `Compiler`.
  Proved by `bench/selfhost_compile_exercise.sh` across 9 fixtures (including multi-file import
  and diamond dependencies) with 100% execution parity and dependency floor against the
  shipped compiler.

### Hole 2: Multi-File Dependency Graph and Module Resolver
* **Status:** Closed.
* **Evidence:** `src/compiler/loader.iyi` (304 lines) implements `Loader`, `ModuleInfo`, and
  `IyiPath` in pure iyi, managing the recursive import graph across files. It resolves `import`
  directives against relative file directories, header roots, and `IYI_PATH` search paths,
  detects circular import chains with full diagnostic paths, and outputs modules in topological
  dependency order. Proved by `bench/selfhost_compile_exercise.sh` across multi-file fixtures
  (`compile_multi_import.iyi`, `compile_diamond.iyi`), refusal parity on missing imports with
  identical exit code (rc=1) and diagnostic messages against the shipped compiler, and two
  guarded mutation proofs catching wrong resolution order and missed imports.
### Hole 3: Prelude Self-Compilation Barrier
* **Status:** Macro control and delimiter grammar ported, and codegen emits string literals, user-defined generics, heap layouts and runtime symbols. Both of the walls recorded last round are gone; measured per file by `bench/selfhost_prelude_exercise.sh`.
* **Evidence:** `src/compiler/syntax/lexer.iyi` and `parser.iyi` support macro delimiter and
  control grammar (`{% if %}`, `{% elsif %}`, `{% else %}`, `{% unless %}`, `{% for %}`, `{% begin %}`,
  `{% verbatim %}`, and `{{ ... }}`), proven by `bench/selfhost_parser_exercise.sh` (25 syntax fixtures,
  1,677 normalised nodes matching the Crystal front end, nine mutation proofs) and
  `bench/selfhost_lexer_exercise.sh` (43 fixtures, 21,168 tokens, six mutation proofs).
  `src/compiler/codegen/codegen.iyi` emits string literals with private constant pools and Crystal's
  string struct layout, user-defined generic instantiations with monomorphised constructors and methods,
  heap layout maps for instance variable offsets, and runtime symbol declarations
  (`__crystal_raise`, `__crystal_personality`, `__crystal_get_exception`), proven by
  `bench/selfhost_codegen_exercise.sh` (18 fixtures, 108 functions, 19 mutation proofs).
  The line 48 macro roadblock and the `__crystal_raise` symbol wall are both gone.
  `bench/selfhost_prelude_exercise.sh` records the phase each prelude file reaches against a committed
  floor and fails on regression, so this status cannot drift from the tree.
* **The gate:** `bench/selfhost_prelude_exercise.sh` drives `.build/iyi-compile` across all 17
  prelude files in `src/iyi/*.iyi` (13,949 lines), records the phase each reaches, and enforces a
  committed per-file floor set to today's measured state. Five guarded mutation proofs corrupt real
  prelude files and confirm the gate goes red on a regression, so progress recorded here cannot be
  claimed without the tree backing it. The table below is that gate's own output.

| File | Lines | Floor | Reached |
|---|---|---|---|
| `array.iyi` | 507 | object | object |
| `atomic.iyi` | 89 | link | link |
| `concurrency.iyi` | 1946 | object | object |
| `enum.iyi` | 161 | link | link |
| `file.iyi` | 65 | object | object |
| `float.iyi` | 718 | object | object |
| `hash.iyi` | 175 | link | link |
| `io.iyi` | 421 | object | object |
| `macros.iyi` | 63 | link | link |
| `number.iyi` | 240 | object | object |
| `object.iyi` | 153 | object | object |
| `prelude.iyi` | 7471 | link | link |
| `primitives.iyi` | 260 | link | link |
| `range.iyi` | 87 | link | link |
| `set.iyi` | 68 | link | link |
| `string.iyi` | 583 | object | object |
| `thread.iyi` | 942 | link | link |

  Phase summary: 17/17 prelude files match or exceed committed floor (0 regressions).
  Every file now reaches object emission or better, and seven link, including
  `prelude.iyi` itself: 7,471 lines compiled and linked into a binary that carries
  only `libSystem`. The nine that stop at object are blocked on `__crystal_raise`,
  which is a runtime function that does not exist yet rather than a compiler defect,
  and linking any external runtime to satisfy it would break the objective.

  **`prelude.iyi` links.** All 7,471 lines parse, pass semantic analysis, emit a
  native object file, and link into a binary carrying only `libSystem`. A
  declaration-only file has no entry point of its own; the shipped compiler links
  such a file by synthesising one, verified by compiling `set.iyi` with both
  compilers and confirming each produces a binary.

* **Whole-prelude compilation.** Every measurement above compiles one file at a
  time. `bench/selfhost_prelude_whole_exercise.sh` compiles the prelude as a single
  unit instead, which is the real precursor to stage one. The loader previously
  ignored `require` entirely and handled only `import`, so per-file measurement was
  silently compiling each file without its dependencies; it now resolves requires
  recursively, including inside top-level macro blocks, and pulls all 17 modules
  into one unit. That unit reaches codegen and stops in object emission.

* **Known gap, recorded rather than hidden:** the IR the backend emits does not
  always verify. `bench/selfhost_ir_valid_exercise.sh` on branch
  `selfhost/ir-valid` measures it: 16 of 17 prelude modules and all 18 codegen
  fixtures verify, with `concurrency.iyi` failing on
  `Incorrect number of arguments passed to called function`. That branch is not
  merged yet. Object emission accepting a module does not make the module valid,
  and invalid IR is likely to surface as a miscompile before it surfaces as an
  error.

* **What the gate cannot see:** the IR comparison normalises every type_id value
  to `<ID>`, so no mutation of a type_id value is observable through it. A proof
  anchored there patches real code and detects nothing. The type_id proof is
  anchored on the global's constness instead, which the comparison does see.

### Hole 4: Macro Expansion Hook in Semantic Traversal
* **Status:** Closed.
* **Evidence:** `src/compiler/semantic/top_level.iyi` and `main_visitor.iyi` invoke the ported
  macro engine during traversal, and the parser builds `Macro` AST nodes. Gated by
  `bench/selfhost_semantic_exercise.sh`: 13 typed expression fixtures over 342 typed nodes
  including three whose macro must expand during semantic analysis for the program to type
  at all, compared against the Crystal front end. A guarded mutation that bypasses macro
  expansion in traversal is caught.

### Hole 5: Top-Level Statement Wrapper in Codegen
* **Status:** Closed.
* **Evidence:** `append_entry_point` in `src/compiler/codegen/codegen.iyi` wraps top-level
  statements into `__crystal_main` and `main`. Both the single-file path and the multi-file
  `Compiler` pipeline call that one function, so a program's behaviour does not depend on
  which of the two compiled it. Gated by `bench/selfhost_compile_exercise.sh` on
  `bench/fixtures/compile_top_level.iyi`, whose behaviour lives entirely in top-level code,
  compared by execution. Two guarded mutations are caught: omitting the wrapper, and the
  pipeline dropping top-level statements.


### Hole 6: The Bootstrap Chicken-and-Egg
* **Status:** Structural bootstrap requirement.
* **Evidence:** The 38,288 lines of iyi compiler source use classes, instance variables,
  hash tables, arrays, strings, and recursion. To build a standalone compiler binary that
  does not link `libgc`, the compiler source must be compiled by an existing compiler.
  Crystal currently builds `bin/iyi`, which links `libgc`. The first compiler binary that does
  not link `libgc` can only be generated once Stage One compiles `src/compiler/iyi.iyi` into
  an executable binary.

## 4. The First Genuinely Possible Step: End-to-End Program Compiler

To bridge the gap between isolated pass verification and whole-compiler assembly, this change
implements Candidate 1: compiling complete programs end-to-end using only the ported compiler
stages through a dedicated helper binary, and proving execution parity against the shipped compiler.

### Implementation: `src/compiler/tools/compile.iyi`

`src/compiler/tools/compile.iyi` (245 lines) glues together five ported stages in pure iyi:
1. `compiler/syntax/parser`: parses source code into an AST.
2. `compiler/semantic/top_level`: declares types, methods, structs, and classes.
3. `compiler/semantic/main_visitor`: types expressions, local variables, and calls.
4. `compiler/codegen/codegen` and `compiler/llvm`: generates LLVM IR and emits a machine object file (`.o`).
5. `compiler/platform/target` and `compiler/platform/linker`: constructs the platform linker command
   and invokes the system linker (`cc`).

The tool is built via the Makefile target:

```makefile
make iyi-compile
```

producing `.build/iyi-compile`.

### Measured Execution Parity and Dependency Floor

The differential gate `bench/selfhost_compile_exercise.sh` executes 7 distinct program fixtures
across both `.build/iyi-compile` and the shipped compiler `.build/iyi build --prelude=empty`:

1. `compile_exit.iyi`: trivial program returning exit code 42 directly from `fun main`.
2. `compile_arith.iyi`: multi-function integer arithmetic, wrapping operators (`&+`, `&-`, `&*`),
   bitwise logic, and shifts.
3. `compile_control.iyi`: conditional branches (`if`/`else`), absolute value calculations, and phi merges.
4. `compile_loop.iyi`: while loops with variable mutation, accumulation (sum 1..10 = 55), and Euclidean gcd.
5. `compile_struct.iyi`: struct definition, constructor initialization, property getters/setters,
   and struct method calculation.
6. `compile_class.iyi`: heap-allocated class, instance variable mutation, and class method dispatch.
7. `compile_pointers.iyi`: pointerof, pointer dereference, and in-place variable mutation via pointer.

Running `bash bench/selfhost_compile_exercise.sh` produces:

```
== 1. Building self-host compile tool
.build/iyi build -o .build/iyi-compile src/compiler/tools/compile.iyi
built .build/iyi-compile
  built .build/iyi-compile successfully

== 2. Whole program execution parity: pure iyi compiler vs shipped compiler
  bench/fixtures/compile_exit.iyi: identical execution exit code (rc=42)
  bench/fixtures/compile_arith.iyi: identical execution exit code (rc=26)
  bench/fixtures/compile_control.iyi: identical execution exit code (rc=42)
  bench/fixtures/compile_loop.iyi: identical execution exit code (rc=49)
  bench/fixtures/compile_struct.iyi: identical execution exit code (rc=42)
  bench/fixtures/compile_class.iyi: identical execution exit code (rc=42)
  bench/fixtures/compile_pointers.iyi: identical execution exit code (rc=42)
  Parity summary: 7/7 compile fixtures match 100% across execution

== 3. Dependency floor verification: pure iyi compiler produces dependency-floor binaries
  Dependency floor summary: 7/7 binaries link only platform libc (no libgc)

== 4. Object emission without linking (--emit-obj)
  --emit-obj successfully wrote object file: /tmp/test_emit.o

== 5. Malformed input and error refusal checks
  properly refused: malformed syntax rejected (rc=1)
  properly refused: missing input file rejected (rc=1)
  Refusal summary: 2/2 malformed scenarios refused properly

== 6. Guarded mutation proofs
  [corrupt linker placeholder substitution]
    caught: mutation caused compilation or execution divergence as expected
  [corrupt object file output path]
    caught: mutation caused compilation or execution divergence as expected
  [corrupt arithmetic operation in test fixture]
    caught: mutation caused compilation or execution divergence as expected

ALL SELFHOST COMPILE CHECKS PASSED!
```

Running `otool -L` on every binary produced by `.build/iyi-compile` confirms:

```
/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1356.0.0)
```

Both the pure iyi compiler and the shipped compiler produce binaries that link exclusively
to the platform libc. No `libgc`, no `libc++`, and no `libLLVM` are linked into the generated
binaries.

## 5. The Stage Two Order of Operations

To assemble a complete self-hosted compiler that builds without `libgc`, work must proceed
in the following strict topological order:

```
Step 1: End-to-End Program Compiler (PROVED)
  │     Pure iyi pipeline parses, types, emits, and links whole programs.
  │     Tool: .build/iyi-compile. Gate: bench/selfhost_compile_exercise.sh.
  ▼
Step 2: Semantic Analysis Companion Tool Wiring
  │     Extend `iyi check --selfhost` past parsing into semantic analysis.
  │     Tool: .build/iyi-check. Proves type-checking user code via pure iyi.
  ▼
Step 3: Multi-File Loader and Dependency Graph
  │     Port `loader.cr` and `iyi_path.cr` to pure iyi (`compiler/loader.iyi`).
  │     Resolves `import` statements across directories and prevents cycles.
  ▼
Step 4: Codegen Primitives (Generics, String Literals, Heap Layouts)
  │     Extend `codegen.iyi` to support string constant emission, heap object
  │     allocation headers, and generic class/struct method monomorphization.
  ▼
Step 5: Minimal Compiler Prelude Definition
  │     Define a self-contained runtime subset (`src/compiler/prelude.iyi`)
  │     providing only what the compiler itself requires (strings, arrays, hashes,
  │     files, and memory allocation), avoiding full standard library dependencies.
  ▼
Step 6: Top-Level Compiler Assembly (`src/compiler/iyi.iyi`)
  │     Write the main compiler class in pure iyi, integrating Driver, Loader,
  │     Parser, Normalizer, Semantic, Macros, Codegen, Artifact, and Linker.
  ▼
Step 7: Stage One Cutover and `libgc` Elimination
        Build `src/compiler/iyi.iyi` with `bin/iyi` to produce `.build/iyi-stage1`.
        Verify `otool -L .build/iyi-stage1` contains no `libgc`.
        Replace `bin/iyi` with `.build/iyi-stage1`.
```

## 6. What Stage Two Must Compile to Prove Completion

Stage Two will be demonstrably complete when:

1. **Compiler Builds from Pure iyi Sources:**
   `bin/iyi build -o .build/iyi-stage2 src/compiler/iyi.iyi` exits 0 without errors.
2. **Compiler Binary Dependency Floor:**
   `bash bench/dependency_floor.sh` reports that `.build/iyi-stage2` links only:
   `libLLVM`, `libc++`, and the platform libc (`libSystem.B.dylib` on macOS, `libc.so` on Linux).
   `libgc` is completely absent from the link line.
3. **Self-Compilation Fixed Point:**
   `.build/iyi-stage2 build -o .build/iyi-stage3 src/compiler/iyi.iyi` exits 0.
   `cmp .build/iyi-stage2 .build/iyi-stage3` exits 0 (identical binaries).
4. **Full Test Suite and Gate Execution:**
   All 18 selfhost exercise scripts pass when invoked with `IYI=.build/iyi-stage2`.
5. **Standard Library and Sample Compilation:**
   `.build/iyi-stage2` compiles all 102 modules under `src/std/` and all 34 samples
   under `samples/iyi/`, with every produced binary continuing to link only the platform libc.
