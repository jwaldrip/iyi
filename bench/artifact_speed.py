"""What reading a module from its `.iyimod` costs, against reading its source.

SPEC.md IV.1a asked this before the artifact existed and answered it with the
fork probe, which is a ceiling rather than a measurement of the thing. This is
the thing: the same program, built from four modules' source and then from four
modules' artifacts with every one of those sources deleted.

Run it after `make crystal` — ideally after `make crystal release=1`, since a
debug compiler is about 1.5x here and both columns pay it.

    python3 bench/artifact_speed.py

What it does not measure is whether the two builds produce the same program;
`spec/compiler/iyimod_spec.cr` and the samples do that, and a speed harness
that also checked correctness would be believed about neither.
