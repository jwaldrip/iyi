# Binds two Crystal shards, each holding a regex literal of its own, and checks
# that a program built against both boundaries prints what the same program
# prints built against their source.
#
# A regex literal does not stay a literal. The compiler turns it into a
# program-level constant, the unit that reads it refers to that constant by
# name, and the name reaches a linker — so the name is part of the boundary
# whether or not anybody wrote it. It used to be assigned by the order the
# literals were met in, which is not an identity two programs share: both of
# the shards below numbered their own from zero and both said `$Regex:0`.
#
# `bench/bind_roundtrip.sh` cannot ask this. One boundary can be wrong about
# the name and still be right about the pattern, because there is nothing for
# it to collide with. It takes two, and the failure it caught is the one worth
# a gate of its own:
#
#     --- source ---            --- artifact ---
#     alpha-[0-9]+              alpha-[0-9]+
#     beta-[a-z]+               alpha-[0-9]+
#
# Nothing raised, nothing failed to link, and the second shard matched against
# the first one's pattern. That is III.6 rule 1's "returns something of another
# type" one level down, and a linker cannot see it.
#
#     bash bench/bind_regex_identity.sh
#
# Needs `make` (both the compiler and `iyi`). Exits non-zero if either bind
# fails, if either arm fails to build or link, or if the two print differently.

# Each shard matches as well as naming its pattern, and the match is the half
# that took longest to make true. Reading the constant says which one the unit
# got; running it says the whole path works, and that path was three separate
# holes deep. `Regex::PCRE2::@@current_jit_stack` is thread-local, so it is
# reached through a `noinline` function in the main module — which does not
# travel. `Regex::MatchOptions` is an enum, and ids are handed out by walking
# `Object`'s subclasses, which does not reach one: a consumer whose own code
# never mentions it numbers it nowhere. Both are fixed, and this line is what
# keeps them fixed.
#
# The explicit `initialize` is not decoration either: `new` is synthesised from
# it rather than read from the artifact, and a class without one leaves the
# consumer asking for a constructor symbol nobody emitted.
