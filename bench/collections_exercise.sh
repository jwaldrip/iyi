# The prelude's collections at their edges: `Array`, `Hash` and `Set`.
#
#     bash bench/collections_exercise.sh
#
# `bench/collections_exercise.iyi` is the program, run plain and optimised.
# Then the panics an empty receiver answers with are driven here - a
# panicking program has no next line to assert on - and then each check is
# proved capable of failing by patching a *copy of the prelude* and building
# against it through `IYI_PATH`. A check that cannot fail is not a check.
#
# The defect this gate was written for: `a.concat(a)`. `each` walked
# *other*'s size while `<<` grew it, so appending an array to itself never
# reached the end; it grew the buffer until the capacity arithmetic
# overflowed, and `[1, 2].concat(itself)` died of "arithmetic overflow".
#
# Exits non-zero if any check fails or if any patch leaves the exercise green.
