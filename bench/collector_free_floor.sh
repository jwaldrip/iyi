# The compiler built without a collector, compiling every sample.
#
# `-Dgc_none` swaps bdw-gc for plain `malloc` and `free`, and that turns a
# class of latent bug into a visible one: bdw-gc rounds a block up and never
# hands the same address out twice while something still points at it, so a
# write one byte past an allocation lands in padding nobody reads. Plain
# `malloc` hands back exactly the size asked for, and the next allocation
# overwrites the byte.
#
# That is what this measures, and it is not a hypothetical. `String::Builder`
# grew its buffer to `real_bytesize + count` while `to_s` writes the string's
# terminator at `@buffer[real_bytesize]`, so any string whose final size
# landed exactly on its capacity had its terminator outside its block. Under
# bdw-gc every program was fine. Under `-Dgc_none` a 116-byte mangled function
# name lost its terminator, LLVM's `strlen` read the next allocation, and
# `samples/iyi/collections.iyi` failed to link 10 times out of 10.
#
# So this is a floor, not a benchmark: a collector is a permitted dependency
# for the compiler, and a memory bug the collector is hiding is not permitted.
# Run it with the fix reverted and it fails; that is the point of it.
#
#   bash bench/collector_free_floor.sh
#
# Exits non-zero if the collector-free compiler cannot be built, if its link
# line still carries a collector, or if any sample fails to compile with it.
