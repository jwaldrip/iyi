"""AI_FIRST.md §5 — the gate the plan wrote before the work.

Two arms. The token arm is hermetic and runs in CI: for each target below,
the surface pack (`iyi mod context FILE`) must be smaller than the raw
grounding it replaces — the sources of the target's import closure, which
is what an agent reads when no pack exists — and must carry no body. The
rounds arm needs a model, so it is pluggable: `--agent 'CMD'` names a
command that reads a prompt on stdin and writes a program on stdout, and
the same task is run twice, pack-grounded and raw-grounded, counting
rounds until the build is green.

Until both arms pass, AI_FIRST.md's own rule holds: no AI-first sentence
is quoted anywhere as fact. The token arm's threshold is written from the
first measurement (webapp 57%, calc 43% of raw) with headroom, not
ambition: the pack must stay under 70% of raw, and any regression past
that is this script exiting 1.

    python3 bench/context_pack.py --agent 'claude -p'   # both arms
