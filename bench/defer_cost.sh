# What `defer` costs, measured — the price III.1.4's registry charges.
#
# The panic path bought its unwind by making every `defer` register a
# cleanup proc at runtime: one node, one closure, pushed on entry and
# popped on exit. That is not free, and this repository does not carry
# unmeasured costs: two release builds, twenty million calls each, one
# with a `defer` in the callee and one without, and the difference is
# the per-defer price, printed and budgeted. The budget is loose (CI
# machines are not laptops); the claim it holds is architectural — a
# defer is nanoseconds, not a syscall.
