# The prelude's `Enum` surface: every method, and the compiler's three uses.
#
#     bash bench/enum_exercise.sh
#
# `bench/enum_exercise.iyi` is the program. It runs plain and optimised, and
# then each check is proved capable of failing by patching a *copy of the
# prelude* — `src/iyi/enum.iyi` with one method broken — and building against
# it through `IYI_PATH`. A check that cannot fail is not a check.
#
# What is being protected is not only the methods. The compiler gives an enum
# `value` and `new` and nothing else, and three things it writes depend on this
# file: a `when` naming a member lowers to `===`, which is `==`; a per-member
# question method (`level.warn?`) is `self == Member`; and a `@[Flags]` enum's
# is `self.includes?(Member)`. Before the surface existed, all three answered
# `Object`'s defaults — `==` was `false`, so `case` matched nothing.
#
# Exits non-zero if any check fails or if any patch leaves the exercise green.

# consumer's own prelude.
#
# Three defects were in the way, each invisible until an enum was exported:
# the question methods the compiler writes carried no return type and R-2
# refused them ("`debug?` is exported and does not say what it returns"); the
# artifact writer asked an enum for its instance variables (`BUG: Level::Level
# doesn't implement instance_vars`); and an enum's members read as code inside
# a type body, so the module could not be imported from an artifact at all.
