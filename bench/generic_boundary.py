"""R-4, measured: what a generic crossing a module boundary costs today.

R-4 says a generic call across a boundary passes a dictionary keyed on
GC shape, and monomorphisation stays inside a module. Nothing in the
compiler does that; what the compiler does instead is R-1's other rule
taken literally: a generic's *body* travels in the artifact and every
consumer compiles it again for the types it uses. So a module made of
generics ships no object code at all, and a consumer's build carries the
library's bodies whether it asked for them or not. That is the design
this repository actually has, and until this file it was "specified and
unmeasured" in the README.

Two readings, both from the artifacts the sample corpus emits:

  1. what travels — per module, bytes by section: exports (the
     declarations a consumer compiles against), mono bodies (what it
     compiles again), macro bodies, object code (what it links and
     never compiles). Read straight off the section table, no decoder.
  2. what it buys — a consumer of a fully generic module, built from
     source and from artifacts, front end only, minimum of ROUNDS: the
     artifact arm still compiles the bodies, so the difference is what
     the declarations save, and what R-4's dictionary would add to it.

Two structural facts are asserted, because they are R-4 as built:
a module with no generic and no macro ships object code and no body;
a module that is all generics ships every body and no object code.
And the share of the corpus that is bodies is held under a line set
from the first measurement with headroom, the way context_pack.py
holds the pack: not a target, a tripwire, so the number in the SPEC
cannot drift without this file saying so.
