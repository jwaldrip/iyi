# Binds pieces of Crystal's own library as boundaries and consumes each.
#
# `bench/yaml_reads.sh` does this for one namespace and holds one claim about
# it. This asks the same question of several, because what a boundary breaks on
# depends on what the namespace *holds*: `JSON` is types and methods, `URI` is
# a struct with a lot of parsing behind it, and `Log` is global state written
# by macros — a private constant, a class variable with a live initialiser, and
# two `{% for %}` loops that write a method of the same name on both sides of
# the class.
#
# `Log` is the one that found things, and it found four. `tool bind` died on it
# with a stack overflow and no diagnosis. A parameter written `Class` is every
# metaclass there is and there is no end to them. A class variable the library
# declares was declared a second time here, so the initialiser that runs was
# not the one the artifact carried. And `MonoBodies` was keyed without the side
# of the type, so `Log.info`'s body took `Log#info`'s key.
#
# `Path` and `Time` arrived later and found one thing between them: a constant
# has two spellings, and which one a build picks is a fact about that build's
# order rather than about the constant. See the comment above them.
#
# The six after them found nothing, and that is worth having too: a gate that
# only holds the cases that once broke says nothing about the ones that never
# did, and "never did" is a claim that stops being true the moment somebody
# changes how a boundary is written.
#
#     bash bench/library_boundaries.sh
#
# Needs `make`. Nothing here reaches the network: what it binds is in this
# checkout.
#
# Exits non-zero if any bind or fill fails, or if any consumer answers
# differently from the same program built from source.
