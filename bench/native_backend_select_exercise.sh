# Backend selection (SPEC 2.1, slice B3). The native-only tool names the backend each target builds with, refuses LLVM by
# name, and writes its verified IR as text that the same tool rebuilds into the executable the hosted compiler builds.
#
# 1. --print-backend prints llvm for each of the five targets while NATIVE_TARGETS is empty.
# 2. --backend llvm is refused with the message a compiler without the LLVM backend gives: exit 1, nothing written.
# 3. --emit ir writes the program's IR; the tool rebuilds that IR and its exit equals the hosted build's.
# 4. Mutation: a triple added to NATIVE_TARGETS changes that target's print from llvm to native, and the gate goes red.
