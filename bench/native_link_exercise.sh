#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The native Mach-O executable gate (SPEC 2.3, slice C2).
#
# 1. The driver (src/compiler/tools/link_macho.iyi) builds from source.
# 2. The hand-built program links, prints its message, exits 7 and passes
#    codesign -v --strict. bench/fixtures/native_link/hello.expected holds that.
# 3. For every samples/iyi/*.iyi the Crystal-hosted compiler emits an arm64 Mach-O
#    object and prints its link line. The native linker links that object with
#    the frameworks the link line names. On macOS the two programs run with no
#    stdin and must match on exit status, stdout and stderr. socket and webapp
#    are linked and checked, not run: socket opens a network socket and webapp
#    serves HTTP until it is stopped.
# 4. Every linked executable: codesign -v --strict passes, there is no
#    __stub_helper section, nm -u lists no dyld_stub_binder, otool -L lists
#    libSystem and only the frameworks the link line names, and LC_BUILD_VERSION
#    lists zero tools.
# 5. Tripwire: the driver runs under a PATH whose ld, cc, clang, codesign and
#    dsymutil are shims that log and exit 1. The log must stay empty.
# 6. Each executable links twice to identical bytes (cmp).
# 7. Mutation proofs (macOS): a CodeDirectory page hash, a library ordinal, and a
#    rebase are each broken in a copy of the source. The check must fail.
#
# Needs a built compiler (`make`). The native-darwin job runs every step; on other
# systems the linking, relinking and tripwire steps run and the rest says so.
