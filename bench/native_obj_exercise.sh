#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The native object gate (SPEC 3.4, slice C1).
#
# For every samples/iyi/*.iyi the Crystal-hosted compiler emits an arm64 Mach-O
# object with --cross-compile --target aarch64-apple-darwin. The native reader
# reads it, the native writer writes it back, and the reader must read the
# result equal to the first read. The driver prints the relocation kinds it
# saw, zero counts included.
#
# On macOS each rewritten object is linked with the link line the compiler
# printed for the original, and the program must match the original's exit
# status and stdout. A sample is excluded only when its original program
# gives different output on two runs, or when it needs the network or a
# server, and each exclusion is named below with its reason.
#
# Mutation proofs break one line of the reader or writer in a copy of the
# source, rebuild the driver, and require the check to fail. The helper
# requires the patch to change something: a patch whose text is absent fails
# the gate. The relinked-program proof needs cc and runs on macOS only.
#
# Needs a built compiler (`make`). Jobs that run this gate: native-linux runs
# the round trip and the drop-ADDEND proof; native-darwin runs every step.
