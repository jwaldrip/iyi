# Native source gate (SPEC 2.2, slice B3). Every compile_* and cg_* fixture is built FROM SOURCE by iyi-compile-native,
# which runs the compiler pipeline with the native backend: no LLVM is linked and no host tool runs (bench/lib/tripwire.sh
# logs and fails ld, cc, clang, gcc, codesign, dsymutil, llvm-config and as).
#
# Reference: the hosted compiler, ./bin/iyi build, of the same program. Each native executable that builds is run, and its
# stdout and exit status must equal the hosted compiler's build. The port+LLVM build (the port's own pipeline with the LLVM
# backend, built from tools/compile.iyi) is a second column, compared the same way and named as what it is.
#
# Every fixture lands in exactly one category:
#   N  run equal to the hosted compiler's build (native vs hosted)
#   G  port gap: the hosted compiler builds and runs it, and the port cannot compile it yet (its first error is shown)
#   R  refused by the native back end only: the hosted compiler and the port+LLVM build both accept it
#   S  refused by the hosted compiler too: a shared refusal, not parity with the port
#   F  failed: the native tool builds what the hosted compiler refuses, or its run differs from the hosted build
#
# Mutations are made to the SOURCE with bench/lib/mutation.sh, and each must be caught by a check that fails on it.
# A self-check of compare_run is labelled separately: it is not a compiler mutation.
