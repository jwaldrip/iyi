# The wasm32-wasi back end gate (SPEC 2.2 wasm32-wasi row, 3.3; slice D5). The back end writes one module
# from an IR program and the native runtime's IR; no linker, no host tool takes part in writing it.
#
#   bench/native_wasm_exercise.sh
#
# Steps, in order:
#   1. the tools build with the hosted compiler, and the embedded runtime text is in sync with its source;
#   2. the module writer and the reader: a hand-built module validates and runs under wasmtime, and the reader
#      lists what the writer wrote;
#   3. every fixture under bench/fixtures/native_wasm/ compiles to a module the reader accepts (imports only
#      wasi_snapshot_preview1, no producers section), runs under wasmtime, and matches its .expected stdout and
#      its .exit status. On darwin the expected output is also recomputed from the aarch64-darwin native build
#      of the same IR (bench/native_wasm_darwin.py), so a stale .expected file is caught here;
#   4. the native_cg corpus under a wasm retarget: each program is built or refused, and every refusal is named;
#   5. mutations of the back end are each caught, and a patch that changes nothing is refused;
#   6. the identity floor.
#
# wasmtime runs the modules: found on PATH, or set WASMTIME. Without it steps 2 and 3 are reported as skipped,
# never passed. Steps that need darwin (the fresh oracle in step 3) are skipped on other hosts.
