#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Whole programs through the native back end (SPEC 2.2; the back half of stage 1). The hosted compiler types and
# lowers a program with the real prelude and writes its LLVM IR; iyi-ir imports that into the iyi IR; the native back
# end compiles and links it with no LLVM and no host tool. The program must then run as the hosted executable runs.
# This is the proof that the back end carries a real program (the allocator, fibers, IO, thread-locals), separate
# from whether the front end written in iyi can produce that IR yet.
#
# 1. iyi-compile-native and iyi-ir build from source. The first links libSystem alone. iyi-ir is the bridge that
#    reads LLVM IR and links LLVM by design; it is not part of the native build.
# 2. Every samples/iyi/*.iyi and bench/fixtures/native_whole/*.iyi: the hosted build (executable and IR), the
#    import, the native build under the tripwire (bench/lib/tripwire.sh), both executables run with no stdin for at
#    most 30 seconds, stdout and exit status compared. Each program reaches a phase: import (the import refused it),
#    native (the back end refused it), run (it ran and differs), run-equal. A program the hosted compiler does not
#    build is listed and not counted.
#    Floor: bench/native_whole_program.floor, "<program> <phase>". A phase may only rise; a program below its floor
#    or missing from it fails the gate. NATIVE_WHOLE_PROGRAM_RAISE=1 writes the floor from this run, keeping the
#    higher phase.
#    A program whose lib blocks link a framework has it named beside its IR (<p.ir>.imports, SPEC 2.3: bridged IR
#    carries no @[Link]; the names are read from the hosted link command). Its executable must load libSystem, those
#    frameworks and nothing else. 2b: a sidecar naming a library the native floor does not provide is refused by name.
# 3. The compiler builds itself in the back half: the tool's own IR is built by the tool (cn1, a compiler with no
#    LLVM in it), cn1 builds the same IR (cn2), and cn1 and cn2 must be the same bytes; cn2 builds hello to the
#    bytes the tool builds it to.
# 4. The tripwire log is empty.
# 5. Mutation proofs on the pieces a whole program needs that no small fixture did.
#
#   bench/native_whole_program_exercise.sh
#
# The native-darwin job runs it through bench/native_gates.sh. Needs a built compiler (`make`) and LLVM for iyi-ir.
