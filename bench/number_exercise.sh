#
#     bash bench/number_exercise.sh
#
# `bench/number_exercise.iyi` is the program, run plain and optimised. Then
# the two panics are driven here - a program that panics has no next line to
# assert on - and then each check is proved capable of failing by patching a
# *copy of the prelude* and building against it through `IYI_PATH`. A check
# that cannot fail is not a check.
#
# What is being protected: `Int32::MIN` has no positive twin, so a parser
# that accumulates the magnitude and negates it cannot read what `to_s`
# wrote, and with checked arithmetic it panicked rather than answering the
# `nil` a `?` promises. And `MIN // -1` is the one division whose result the
# type does not hold: left to the processor it traps, and the program dies of
# "a floating-point system exception" for an integer divide - the same
# sentence the zero divisor used to give before it was checked here.
#
# Exits non-zero if any check fails or if any patch leaves the exercise green.
