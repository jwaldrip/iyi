#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A module used as a type, across a boundary: the consumer's includer is in the
# set (SPEC.md III.6).
#
#     bash bench/open_dispatch.sh
#
# `bench/open_dispatch_fixture/` is forty lines and no shard. `Chainy::Link` is
# a module held as a type — `@next : Link | Nil`, the shape every kemal
# middleware chain has — so a call on it is compiled as one type-id test per
# *including* type, and the includers are whichever ones the build that
# compiled the test happened to have. The consumer writes `Mine`, joins that
# set, and the producer's compiled dispatch matches none of its cases.
#
# From source the two files print `first mine end`. Through the boundary they
# printed `first ` and stopped, and a kemal application did the same thing one
# request in: `codegen_dispatch` ends in `unreachable`, so what happens after
# the last case is whatever the optimiser left there.
#
# The rule that fixes it makes such a body travel, and the closure reaches the
# bodies that *call* one. Both arms are run here: with the rule, and with
# `IYI_OPEN_TRAVEL=off`, which writes the boundary the way it was written
# before it. A gate that cannot fail is not a gate.
#
# Needs `make` only — no shard, no network. Exits non-zero if either bind or
# fill fails, if the boundary arm does not answer what the source arm answers,
# or if the rule turned off still answers it.
