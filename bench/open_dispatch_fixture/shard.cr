# The shape an artifact could not carry, in forty lines and no shard.
#
# `Chainy::Link` is a module used as a *type*: `@next : Link | Nil` holds
# whatever includes it, and a call on that field is compiled as a test per
# includer. The includers are whatever the *producing* build had — `First`
# and `Last` — so the machine code in the artifact answers a question only
# the whole program can answer.
#
# A consumer that writes its own `Link` joins the set and the artifact's copy
# cannot know:
#
#     iyi tool bind --crystal -e Chainy --emit-bind mods shard.cr
#     iyi build --crystal --iyi-keep Chainy --emit-bind mods --use-iyimod mods \
#       -o keep mods/chainy_keep.cr
#     iyi run --crystal --use-iyimod mods app.iyi
#
# printed `first ` and stopped, where the same two files built from source
# print `first mine end`. This is the miniature of the defect an application
# hit: kemal's handler chain is `@next : HTTP::Handler | Nil`, every
# middleware a person writes joins that set, and
# `Kemal::InitHandler@HTTP::Handler#call_next` matched none of its cases, fell
# through to the `Proc` arm of the union and jumped through a pointer that was
# never a function — a segfault on the first request, behind a front end that
# compiled clean.
#
# It is a gate now: `bash bench/open_dispatch.sh` runs both arms, and
# `IYI_OPEN_TRAVEL=off` is the one that still prints `first ` (SPEC.md III.6).
