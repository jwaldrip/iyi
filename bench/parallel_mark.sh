# Five steps, the last three failure proofs:
#   1. The program holds, release: a million-node tree survives five marks
#      alone and five with helpers, and the helpers blackened nodes; the
#      pool holds a handful of pieces after them; a worker's stack grew to
#      hold a 300,000-wide object marked alone.
#   2. The two pause means, printed: alone against with helpers.
#   3. Failure proof: the marker's donation of its stack's bottom removed
#      from a copy of the prelude; the helpers wake and find nothing, and
#      the program exits 1 saying so.
#   4. Failure proof: a batch taken is never freed; the pool's pieces pile
#      up past the bound, and the pool check says so.
#   5. Failure proof: a stack that will not grow dies where it used to,
#      by name, on the wide object.
