"""The rebuild, measured — and the prediction it corrects.

The naive reading of R-1 says an artifact rebuild should beat a source
rebuild: imports read, not compiled. Measured, it does not — not on the
sample corpus (~1.0x) and not on a 400-type semantic-heavy fixture
(~0.85x): the front end types lazily, so unused import surface is
nearly free to compile, while the artifact arm pays decode and
re-declaration for everything it reads. The wall-time dividend R-1
actually delivers lives elsewhere, and each home is separately gated:
the LSP's per-module verdict (bench/lsp_latency.py), building with the
library's *source deleted* (bench/samples_roundtrip.sh), and the
interface hash that rebuilds nobody on a doc edit (iyimod specs).

What this file gates is what the loop still owes: the edit-rebuild
round trip stays cheap in absolute terms on either arm, and the
artifact read never becomes ruinously slower than the compile it
replaces — a regression band, so decode cost cannot quietly grow.
Arms alternate, an edit precedes every build, minimums are reported.
