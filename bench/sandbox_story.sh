# The claim: an iyi program compiled for wasm32-wasi is the cheapest
# container for running code nobody trusts — generated code most of all.
# Three steps, the second and third being what a sandbox is *for*:
#
#   1. An honest program computes and prints through the boundary.
#   2. A program that tries to read the host's files dies with the refusal
#      named, and not one byte of the file in its output — under a default
#      wasmtime, which preopens nothing.
#   3. The refusal is the prelude's own, so it names iyi's rule rather
#      than a trap code: File has no wasm32 surface at all.
