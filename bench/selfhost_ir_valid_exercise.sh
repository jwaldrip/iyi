# that LLVMVerifyModule rejects, which was found only because a stray
# mod.verify was left in the emit path and demoted them.
#
# The shipped compiler does not verify in its emit path and neither does this
# one: matching its behaviour matters. The check belongs here instead, with a
# committed floor per file so a file that verifies today cannot quietly stop.
#
# A file listed as "pass" MUST verify. A file listed as "known-fail" is
# recorded with its verifier message in STAGE_TWO.md and is allowed to fail;
# if it starts passing, this gate says so and the floor should be raised.
