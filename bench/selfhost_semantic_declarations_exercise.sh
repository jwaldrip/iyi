#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Burn-down gate for declaration parity between the iyi semantic port and the
# hosted front end's top-level pass (specification S1b).
#
# Every file is analysed bare (no prelude), with the closure of what it imports
# and requires, by the hosted front end's top-level pass
# (bench/selfhost_semantic_declarations_oracle.cr) and by the iyi port
# (bench/selfhost_semantic_declarations_exercise.iyi). Both search IYI_PATH, set
# below to this checkout's src/. Both print one text dump of the declarations the
# file itself makes: defs, types, nested types, their visibility, superclasses,
# type variables, enum members, aliases and constants. A declaration belongs to
# the file when its location is the file, so an imported file's declarations are
# not repeated. The dump is split into records, one per declaration header
# (a "Type:" or "Def:" line) with its own property lines. A record agrees when
# both sides print it identically. The gate counts agreeing records per file.
#
#   bash bench/selfhost_semantic_declarations_exercise.sh
#
# Verifies:
#   1. The oracle and the port's driver build.
#   2. Every bench/fixtures/semdecl_*.iyi is dumped byte-identical by both sides.
#   3-5. Corpora burn-down: the port's own source (src/compiler), the prelude
#        (src/iyi), std (src/std) and the samples (samples/iyi). Each file's
#        agreeing-record count is checked against the committed floor
#        (bench/selfhost_semantic_declarations.floor), which may only rise. A
#        file the oracle cannot analyse is reported ORACLE with its reason and
#        is not measured. A file the port rejects counts zero and is reported PORT.
#   6. Guarded mutation proofs on the fixtures (bench/lib/mutation.sh).
#
# Environment:
#   SEMDECL_RAISE=1         write the floor up to the measured counts (never lower)
#   SEMDECL_FILES=<f>       measure only the repo-relative paths listed in <f>
#   SEMDECL_FLOOR=<f>       read and write this floor file instead of the default
#
# Exit status 0 when every check passes, 1 otherwise.
