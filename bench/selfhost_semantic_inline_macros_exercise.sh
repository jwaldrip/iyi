# Burn-down gate for inline macro expansion in the declarations pass (specification
# S1b-M). The pass expands each `{% if %}`, `{% for %}` and `{{ }}` site at the top
# level and in type bodies with the macro engine, parses the output in the site's
# file and declares what it makes.
#
# Every file is analysed bare (no prelude), with the closure of what it imports and
# requires, by the hosted front end's top-level pass (the oracle,
# bench/selfhost_semantic_inline_macros_oracle.cr, which keeps what a macro declares) and by the iyi port
# (bench/selfhost_semantic_inline_macros_exercise.iyi). Both print one text dump of
# the declarations the file makes, and a record agrees when both sides print it
# identically. The gate counts agreeing records per file.
#
# It also accounts for the file's own macro sites: the sites the scan finds at the
# top level and in type bodies (def bodies belong to the bodies slice), and how the
# pass went with each one the port visited. A site is expanded, refused by the
# engine (with its reason), or not reached. A refusal is printed, never dropped.
#
#   bash bench/selfhost_semantic_inline_macros_exercise.sh
#
# Verifies:
#   1. The oracle and the port's driver build.
#   2. Every bench/fixtures/seminl_*.iyi is dumped byte-identical by both sides, and
#      the port's pass refuses none of its sites.
#   3-6. Corpora burn-down: the port's own source (src/compiler), the prelude
#        (src/iyi), std (src/std) and the samples (samples/iyi). Each file's
#        agreeing-record count is checked against the committed floor
#        (bench/selfhost_semantic_inline_macros.floor), which may only rise. A file
#        the oracle cannot analyse is reported ORACLE and is not measured. A file the
#        port rejects counts zero and is reported PORT.
#   7. Guarded mutation proofs on the fixtures (bench/lib/mutation.sh).
#   8. Pipeline reach: hello and the reach fixture's root through the pipeline tool with the prelude, against
#      bench/selfhost_inline_reach.floor, with three mutation proofs on the reach fixture.
#
# Environment:
#   SEMINL_RAISE=1         write the floor up to the measured counts (never lower)
#   SEMINL_FILES=<f>       measure only the repo-relative paths listed in <f>
#   SEMINL_FLOOR=<f>       read and write this floor file instead of the default
#
# Exit status 0 when every check passes, 1 otherwise.
