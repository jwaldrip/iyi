# Fails when the port's generated `new` methods stop agreeing with the hosted front
# end's (specification S1n: `new`, the generated `new` of each initialize, the
# default `new`, and the targets calls to `new` are given).
#
# Each bench/fixtures/semnew_*.iyi is analysed bare, through the top-level pass, the
# new pass and the main pass, by the hosted oracle (bench/selfhost_semantic_new_oracle.cr)
# and by the port's driver (bench/selfhost_semantic_new_exercise.iyi). Both print the
# same lines: each generated `new` (its signature and body shape) and each `new` call
# (receiver, argument types, result, target). The outputs must be byte-identical.
#
# Mutation proofs patch the port's ported code, rebuild the driver, and require a
# divergence from the hosted oracle. A patch that changes nothing is refused.
