# Drives bench/server_load.iyi: the shape every server has — a fiber per
# connection, both halves parked on the poller, a collection in the
# middle — and the two things that shape used to break.
#
#     bash bench/server_load.sh
#
# Four steps, and two of them are failure proofs, because a gate that
# cannot fail is not a gate:
#
#   1. The program holds, plain build: two hundred connections answered,
#      the collector runs while fibers are parked, nothing is damaged,
#      and the connections ran on a handful of stacks rather than two
#      hundred.
#   2. The same, release.
#   3. Failure proof: the poller's event buffer held as an address again
#      — a `UInt64` where the field is a pointer — and the collector,
#      precise over a typed object's fields, cannot see it. The kernel
#      writes epoll's answers into a chunk the allocator has handed to
#      somebody else and the program dies. This is `wrk -c 100` against
#      the sample web application, made small.
#   4. Failure proof: a finished fiber's stack not handed back, and the
#      two hundred connections take two hundred mappings.
