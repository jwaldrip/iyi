# Installs a real shard, builds an iyi program that requires it, and asks the
# program for two pages over HTTP.
#
# This is the README's headline example taken literally: `require "kemal"` in
# an `.iyi` file, built `--crystal`, serving. Nothing here checked it. The
# samples cannot — none of them requires a shard, which is the whole point of
# the example — and CI's tarball job builds a *synthetic* shard against
# `crystal/syntax_highlighter` to prove the library ships whole. That catches a
# missing file. It cannot catch a language rule that a real shard breaks, an
# ecosystem macro that iyi's parser refuses, or a route block that does not
# compile, and every one of those would leave the headline claim false with
# every gate green.
#
#     bash bench/shard_serves.sh
#
# Needs `make` and the network, which is what makes it the only gate here that
# reaches outside the checkout. The shard is pinned, so what it fetches is one
# version rather than whatever is current.
#
# Exits non-zero if the shard does not install, if the program does not build,
# if the server does not come up, or if either page is not what the routes say.
