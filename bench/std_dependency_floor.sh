# Fails when iyi's standard library grows a dependency.

# `bench/dependency_floor.sh` builds the samples and checks what they link. The
# samples are not the surface a user imports: `src/std` is. This builds every
# module in it, alone, and checks the binary that comes out.
#
#     bash bench/std_dependency_floor.sh
#
# Why a second floor rather than a wider first one: the tree still vendors
# Crystal's bindings, and they still carry live attributes.
#
#     src/openssl   21 files   @[Link("ssl")], @[Link("crypto")]
#     src/yaml      17 files   @[Link("yaml", pkg_config: "yaml-0.1")]
#     src/xml       16 files   @[Link("xml2", pkg_config: "libxml-2.0")]
#     src/compress  18 files   @[Link("z")]

#     src/big        8 files   @[Link("gmp")]
#
# None of them is reachable from iyi code today, measured rather than assumed.
# But one `import` that reaches one of those files puts an ancestor library
# back on the link line of every program that imports the module, and until
# this script existed nothing would have said so. The bindings are inert, not
# absent, and inert is a property that has to be checked to stay true.
#
# Three ways this goes red, because a check that only reports good news is not
# a check:
#
#   1. A module links something other than the platform libc. Names the module
#      and the library.
#   2. A module that used to build alone stops building. A quietly smaller
#      count is a regression hiding as a pass.
#   3. A module recorded below as a known failure starts passing, or fails with
#      a different error than the one on record. A recorded reason that has
#      gone stale is worse than no reason, because it reads as understood.
#
# Needs `make` for bin/iyi, plus `otool` on darwin or `readelf` on Linux.

# The four that differ are oauth, oauth2, websocket and spec. They are not
# dependency findings and they are not broken here. They fail under a compiler
# carrying the semantic rule that refuses `rescue` in an iyi file, because
# `src/std/dns.iyi` uses `begin`/`rescue` and the first three reach it, and
# because `src/std/spec.iyi` declares `pub class SpecError < Exception` while
# `Std::Exception` is a module. Both are error-model work, tracked separately.
#
# So this list stays empty and the floor stays at the full count. When the two
# trees converge, four modules will stop building and failure mode 2 will say
# so by name, which is the correct outcome: the gate reports it rather than a
# list of excuses absorbing it in advance.
