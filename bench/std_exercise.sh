# Three modules reach the platform themselves. Two were written before the
# rule: `socket` (raw syscalls on Linux, libSystem on darwin, SPEC.md III.9)
# and `time` (the clocks). `math` may name the three LLVM hardware intrinsics
# `llvm.sqrt`, `llvm.copysign` and `llvm.fma` (the instruction, not libm).
#
# `debug` is the third, and it is a deliberate exception rather than an
# oversight. It resolves a panic's frames to `file:line:column` by reading the
# program's own DWARF, and finding those bytes is not something the prelude's
# intrinsics can do: it needs the image's load address and ASLR slide
# (`_dyld_get_image_vmaddr_slide`), the executable's path
# (`_NSGetExecutablePath`, `dladdr`), and the file mapped to read it
# (`open`, `mmap`, `munmap`, `lseek`, `close`). Every one of those is in
# libSystem, the platform libc `bench/dependency_floor.sh` already permits, so
# this costs no library: a program importing `std/debug` still links
# libSystem and nothing else, which the floor checks separately.
#
# `file`, `dir` and `udp` are platform modules of `socket`'s shape: raw
# syscalls on Linux, libSystem on darwin, and the floor names every symbol
# they add there.
#
# Whether `file` and `dir` should keep those bindings at all was left open for
# a while, and it is settled by measurement rather than by taste: a program
# that imports both and calls into them links **libSystem and nothing else**.
# The two declare `LibC` and `LibKernel32` only, 29 `fun`s between them, so
# what they reach is the platform libc that Appendix B #19 already permits and
# `ALLOWED_LIBS_PROGRAM` already lists. They cost no ancestor library, which is
# the property the whole dependency floor exists to hold, so they stay as they
# are. Shrinking them to the prelude's intrinsics would move the same syscalls
# into the prelude and spend its measured line budget to change nothing a
# program links.
#
# Every other module is iyi over the prelude's own intrinsics: no `lib`,
# no `fun`, no inline `asm`, no `@[Link]`. A binding that appears anywhere
# else is a dependency being taken on without a word.
# An exemption is permission to reach the *platform*, not permission to reach
# anything. The exempt modules used to be skipped outright, so `@[Link("yaml")]`
# added to `std/socket` was seen by nothing here: the library floor catches it
# only once a program reaches it and links libyaml, and a declaration nothing
# reaches yet is exactly what this loop exists to name. So they are checked
# too, against the libraries the platform supplies.
