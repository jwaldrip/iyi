# resolve out of the package with nothing else on the machine — no IYI_PATH,
# no CRYSTAL_PATH, no Crystal, no checkout.
#
# Two states this is written against, both real. 0.11.0 shipped
# `share/iyi/src/iyi` and nothing beside it, so `import std/enumerable`
# answered "can't find module" for everybody who downloaded it. And between
# `src/std/` being made and `install_iyi` naming it, the directory rode into
# the tarball as a passenger of the other language's library
# (`share/iyi/crystal/std/`) and resolved out of a library it is not part of.
# A gate that runs `hello.iyi` passes in both states, which is why this one
# reads the package instead.
#
# Takes the root of an unpacked tarball, or an `install_iyi` DESTDIR;
# defaults to `.build/iyi-package`. Exits non-zero if any check fails.
