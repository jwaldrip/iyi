# The prelude's value types - a tuple and a range: their equality, their
# hash, and every collection that asks one of those two questions.
#
#     bash bench/value_exercise.sh
#
# `bench/value_exercise.iyi` is the program. It runs plain and optimised, and
# then each check is proved capable of failing by patching a *copy of the
# prelude* - `src/iyi/object.iyi` with one method broken - and building
# against it through `IYI_PATH`. A check that cannot fail is not a check.
#
# What is being protected is the agreement, not the two methods. `==` and
# `hash` were the ones the prelude never wrote for either type, so `Object`'s
# answered - identity, on a value type - and `{1, 2} == {1, 2}` and
# `(1..3) == (1..3)` were both false. Everything
# that asks a value whether it is equal was wrong with it: a tuple key was
# never found in a `Hash`, a `Set` of them was a list, `includes?`, `index`
# and `uniq` over `zip`'s own result answered no, and a `case` over a tuple
# matched nothing, because a `when` is `===` and `===` is `==`.
#
# Exits non-zero if any check fails or if any patch leaves the exercise green.
