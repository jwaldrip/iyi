#
# Every case here is a mistake a person makes at the command line, and the
# claim is the same for all of them: the answer is a sentence naming what
# was asked for, not a stack trace out of the compiler's own guts. Three
# defects this file was written for, each found by trying it:
#
#   * `iyi daemon start --socket <a path longer than the kernel takes>` died
#     with "Path size exceeds the maximum size of 107 bytes (ArgumentError)"
#     and a backtrace through `src/socket/address.cr` - a file the author
#     never opened, about a socket they did ask for.
#   * A `.iyi` file of unreadable bytes was reported as "not a valid Crystal
#     source file", which names the other language for this one's file.
#   * `-o nodir/prog` reached `ld.lld` and came back as "cannot open output
#     file", from a program the author did not run, after a whole
#     compilation had been paid for.
#
# So each case asserts three things: a non-zero exit, a phrase that names the
# thing, and *no* trace - no "Unhandled exception", no "(SomeError)" tail, no
# "from /.../src/" frame. The trace detector is proved against a recording of
# the daemon crash at the end, because a check that cannot fail is not a
# check.
#
# Exits non-zero if any case fails.
