# Installs the latest iyi release into ~/.local (bin/, lib/, share/iyi/):
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iyilang/iyi/master/install.sh | sh
#
# IYI_PREFIX       where to unpack, default ~/.local; the tarball is relocatable
# IYI_VERSION      a release to pin, e.g. 0.12.0; default is the latest release
# IYI_RELEASE_URL  where the release's files are, default the GitHub release;
#                  CI points it at a directory (file://) to install a tarball
#                  before it is released, which is how this script is gated
#
# POSIX sh, curl and tar are all it needs. The release is resolved by
# following GitHub's /releases/latest redirect, not the API, so there is
# no token and no rate limit in the way. The tarball is checked against
# the SHA256SUMS the release publishes beside it before anything is
# unpacked: what comes out of it reaches the linker, so a byte that is
# not the byte the release job wrote is refused rather than run.
