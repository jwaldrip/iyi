# The iyi-written codegen slice against the current compiler, by what the
# programs do rather than by what they emit.
#
# Every other slice diffs an artifact: a token stream, a tree, a
# declaration, a type. Two independent backends do not write the same
# LLVM IR, and diffing the text would measure spelling. So each fixture
# ends in `__iyi_exit`, both compilers turn it into an executable, and
# this compares the status the two processes exit with. That is the one
# observable both can be asked for without a runtime underneath the port.
#
# A fixture that exits 0 either way would pass for free, so a fixture is
# required to exit non-zero and the gate says so rather than counting it.
