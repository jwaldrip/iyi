# `oracle.cr` runs the real top-level semantic pass and prints what the
# file declared. `declare.iyi` walks the port's own tree and prints the
# same. A port that answers the same for every file is evidence; a port
# that answers for none of them and is never run is not.
#
# Three of the samples have no oracle: `collections`, `immutable` and
# `webapp` declare types whose bodies name something an import brings,
# and this pass resolves no imports. They are reported as having no
# oracle rather than skipped, so the number says what it is measuring.
