# iyi: `iyi daemon start` hands the server over to a binary named after the
# binary that was typed — `iyi-daemon`, not `crystal-daemon` (SPEC.md IV.1d).

# Worth pinning, because getting it wrong is quiet rather than loud. The two
# binaries are the same compiler and report the same `Crystal::Config`, so the
# version handshake between an `iyi` client and a `crystal` server passes: builds
# would be served, by a daemon holding a prelude that was chosen for the other
# command surface.
