# iyi: what `crystal tool bind` writes, read back by a build.
#
# The tool had no spec at all, and the shape of what that cost is the reason
# this one exists. Everything it checked was a number it printed — how much of a
# surface crosses, what the boundary waits on — and a number cannot say whether
# anything can *consume* the artifact printed beside it. So nothing ever did,
# and when somebody finally tried by hand, neither root shape worked: a module
# root declared `Any` while its own fields named `JSON::Any`, and a class root
# rendered a `def` where no type was open.
#
# The consumer runs with `no_codegen` on purpose. What broke was the
# declarations, and reading them back is the whole claim here. Linking is a
# separate one — it needs `nm` and `objcopy`, which is a pipeline rather than a
# spec, and a spec that shelled out to binutils would be testing this machine.

# The program `tool bind` reads: a Crystal source, analysed under Crystal's own
# library, which is what the tool needs and why it lives in the compiler.
