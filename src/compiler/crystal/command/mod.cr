# iyi: `crystal mod dump FILE` — read a `.iyimod` back as text.
#
# Under the eventual `iyi` binary this reads `iyi mod dump`, which is the
# spelling SPEC.md IV.1 uses. It is required rather than optional there, and the
# reason is worth keeping in view: an opaque cache format is one nobody can
# debug, and a build cache that cannot be inspected is a build cache that gets
# distrusted and disabled.
