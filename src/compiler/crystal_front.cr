# **Why it exists is a measurement.** `crystal build --no-codegen` never calls
# LLVM and pays 0.026 s for linking it anyway: libLLVM's load-time initialisers
# are charged to any process with a `NEEDED` entry on the library, whether or
# not it generates code. That was two thirds of the figure 0.1.0's target is set
# on. This binary links none, so what it costs is what the analysis costs.
#
# It is deliberately not a second `Iyi::Command`: the driver is thirty
# lines because everything else in a build — object files, a linker, a cache —
# belongs to the half that is missing. See `crystal/llvm_shim.cr` and SPEC.md
# 0.1.0.
