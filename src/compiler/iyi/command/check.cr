# iyi: `iyi check` — the front end's verdict and nothing else.
#
# The cheapest question an agent can ask the compiler is "is this
# program well-typed?". `check` is `build --no-codegen` with its name
# said plainly — no object files, no linker, no artifact; the verdict is
# the exit code, and under `-f json` every error arrives as data,
# `suggested_edit` included.
#
# The blind spot this verb once patched is now the language's own rule:
# definition-site typing (semantic/definition_typing.cr) types every
# fully declared def at its definition, in every compile — so `check`
# is one pass again, and a build, the LSP and this verb cannot disagree
# about what "clean" means. The verb that grew the probe kept none of
# it; the compiler did.

        Usage: #{Command.program_name} check [switches] [program file]
               #{Command.program_name} check --affected CHANGED [--affected CHANGED]...

        Type-check the program and produce nothing: no codegen, no
        binary. Exit 0 means well-typed; errors print like a build's,
        and `-f json` makes each one data — file, line, column, size,
        message, the SPEC sections it cites, and, when the compiler
        knows the fix, a `suggested_edit` with the exact replacement.

        Every def with a fully written signature is typed even if
        nothing calls it — definition-site typing is the language's
        rule, and R-2's declared types stand in for the missing caller.

        `--affected CHANGED` (repeatable) checks the ripple instead of
        one file: every .iyi under the current directory whose imports
        reach a changed file is compiled alone, and every failure is
        named.
        USAGE
      exit
    end

    # `--affected CHANGED...`: the ripple check. `test --affected` answers
    # "which tests re-run"; this answers the sibling question "does
    # everyone who imports the change still compile" — every .iyi file
    # whose parsed import closure reaches a changed file is compiled
    # alone, and every failure is named. A deleted changed file fails its
    # consumers here naturally, which is the loud answer this verb owes
    # (test selection, which cannot afford to guess, turns its discount
    # off instead).
