# iyi: `iyi run --sandbox` — the cheapest container for generated code.
#
# SPEC.md III.12 measured this and the bench proved it: a program
# compiled for wasm32-wasi cannot open a file, a socket, or a clock the
# runtime did not hand it, and a default wasmtime hands it nothing. The
# theft dies with "File is not available on wasm32-wasi", by name. Until
# now that was a bench; an agent running code it just generated wants it
# as a verb.
#
# The pipeline is exactly the one CI runs (bench/sandbox_story.sh):
# cross-compile to wasm32-wasi — which *prints* the link command rather
# than running it, because the target toolchain is not ours — then run
# that command with wasi-sdk's clang standing as `cc`, then execute
# under wasmtime with no preopens. Three tools, each found or named:
# a sandbox that silently fell back to native would be a lie with a
# flag on it.

          Usage: #{Command.program_name} run --sandbox <file> [-- args]

          Compile <file> for wasm32-wasi and run it under wasmtime with
          nothing preopened: no filesystem, no network, no environment.
          The program computes and prints; everything else is refused by
          the runtime, by name.

          Needs a wasi-sdk clang (IYI_WASI_CC, $WASI_SDK/bin/clang,
          /opt/wasi-sdk/bin/clang or ~/.local/opt/wasi-sdk/bin/clang)
          and wasmtime (IYI_WASMTIME or on PATH). Missing tools are
          named, never worked around.
