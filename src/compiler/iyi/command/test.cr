# iyi: `iyi test` — the verify loop, with no framework to learn
# (AI_FIRST.md §2 #4).
#
# A test is a plain iyi program named `*_test.iyi`: it asserts by exiting
# non-zero, exactly the contract every gate in `bench/` already runs on,
# because this repository's own culture is the framework. No DSL, no
# matchers, no registry — a program that prints what failed and exits 1 is
# a failing test, and one that exits 0 passed.
#
#     iyi test              # every *_test.iyi under the current directory
#     iyi test dir file.iyi # these, recursing into directories
#     iyi test --json       # the run as data, for a harness
#     iyi test --affected FILE  # only tests whose imports reach FILE
#
# `--affected` is the edit loop's discount, and its rule is runtime truth,
# not a heuristic: a test is affected exactly when the changed file is in
# its transitive import closure — computed by parsing, never by compiling,
# because R-1 makes the import list syntax. Note what the rule is *not*:
# interface hashes. An edit that leaves a module's interface untouched
# still changes what a consumer's test executes, so "the surface did not
# move" exempts a consumer from *recompiling*, never from *re-running*.
# The closure is the whole answer, and it is exact.
#
# Each test builds and runs alone: one file, one process, one verdict — a
# crash, a panic and a deadlock are all failures that name their file. A
# test that neither exits nor fails is killed at the deadline (`--timeout`,
# 60 s default), because a harness that can hang is not a harness.

    <<-USAGE
    Usage: #{Command.program_name} test [--json] [--timeout SECONDS] [--affected FILE]... [paths]

    Runs every `*_test.iyi` under the given paths (default: `.`). A test is
    a plain iyi program: exit 0 is a pass, anything else is a failure that
    prints its own evidence. `--json` reports the run as data.

    `--affected FILE` (repeatable) runs only the tests whose transitive
    import closure contains a named file — name every file you changed.
    The closure is read by parsing, so selection costs milliseconds; a
    deleted file turns the discount off, because nothing can prove the
    tests that imported it unaffected.
