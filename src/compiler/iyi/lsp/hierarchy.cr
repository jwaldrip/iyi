# iyi: the call graph, off the typed result — call hierarchy for the
# protocol, and the question agents ask most: who calls this, and what
# does this call. A node is a *written* def, keyed by its source
# location, so a generic's many instantiations collapse back to the one
# line the person wrote. Incoming answers merge across the session's
# open documents, the same way references do and for the same R-1
# reason: a def's callers live in its consumers' compiles.
