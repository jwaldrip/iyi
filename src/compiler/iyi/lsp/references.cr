# iyi: references, off the typed graph — the inverse of
# `ImplementationsVisitor`. A reference is not "the same spelling"; it is
# a call whose `target_defs` resolved to the def under the cursor. That
# is the difference between a language server and a text search, and the
# typed AST already knows it: overloads that share a name but not a
# resolution stay untouched, and callers in other modules are found
# because the front end bound them, not because a regex hoped.
#
# The def under the cursor is keyed by its *source location*: every typed
# instantiation of one written def carries the def's own location, so one
# key collects all of them and a generic's many instances count as one
# answer.
#
# Two passes over one typed result. The first finds what the cursor
# names — a call adopts its `target_defs`, a def adopts itself. The
# second collects every call that resolves into the adopted set, every
# declaration that carries an adopted key, and every `using` selection
# of an adopted name — the gate found that last one by renaming a def
# and watching the `using` line it left behind refuse to compile.
