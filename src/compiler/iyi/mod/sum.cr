# iyi: `iyi.sum` — III.7 step 2. The spec's split, kept exactly: `iyi.mod`
# is policy, written by a person; `iyi.sum` is fact, written by the tool,
# "and its only job is to notice that what arrived is not what arrived
# last time."
#
# One line per requirement the build actually used:
#
#     example.test/user/liba v1.1.0 s1:9f2a…
#
# The hash is a tree hash of the checkout: every file, sorted by relative
# path, digested as `<relpath>\0<bytes>`; SHA-1, spelled `s1:` so nobody
# mistakes it for a signature — III.7 is explicit that distribution-grade
# integrity is a whole-artifact signature and a published key, and that is
# a later step. Change detection is this file's whole ambition.
#
# The verbs, and who conjugates them: an entry that matches is silence, an
# entry that differs is a refusal naming both hashes, and a requirement
# with no entry is appended — the tool records facts, it does not ask a
# person to transcribe hashes.
