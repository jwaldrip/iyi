# iyi: which method bodies cannot cross a boundary as object code, because
# their machine code is the whole program's answer (SPEC.md III.6).
#
# IV.1g says this about blocks and generics: an instantiation the *consumer*
# makes is an instantiation no producer could have emitted, so the body travels
# and the consumer compiles it. This is the same sentence said about **sets**.
#
# A module used as a type is the open case. `@next : HTTP::Handler | Nil` is
# dispatched as one type-id test per including type, and the includers are
# whichever types the build that compiled the test happened to have. A consumer
# writes one middleware of its own, joins that set, and the producer's compiled
# dispatch matches none of its cases — `codegen_dispatch` ends in `unreachable`,
# so what a kemal application did with it was boot and fault on the first
# request. `bench/open_dispatch_fixture/` is the same defect in forty lines.
#
# Two kinds of def are marked here, and the second is why this is a walk rather
# than a predicate:
#
# 1. The one holding the dispatch. Its call is marked during semantic analysis,
#    where the open set is read (`Call#lookup_matches_in`).
# 2. Every def that **calls** one, transitively. A caller compiled by the
#    producer binds to the producer's copy of the callee by name, so its own
#    machine code carries the stale answer one call deep. The closure stops at
#    the boundary: the consumer's own code is compiled by the consumer already.
#
# What "marked" buys is what IV.1g's other cases already buy. The body goes in
# `MonoBodies`, the keep file leaves it alone, so the producer emits no symbol
# for it, and the consumer compiles it against the set *it* has.
#
# **Every callee, because a copy is one too.** The obvious bound is the
# module's own types: everything else is the consumer's to compile, so the
# symbol a shard's object code calls is the consumer's own, compiled against
# the consumer's includers. It is the wrong bound, and IV.1g says why. While a
# module's unit is being emitted, a callee the module does not own is *copied*
# into that unit with internal linkage (`iyi_closure_host`) — so a library
# method with a dispatch in it is in the artifact, holding the producer's set,
# and the only thing that replaces it is a caller that travels.
#
# So the walk follows every call. What that costs was measured rather than
# feared: on kemal's four boundaries, nothing at all — the same 325, 36, 35 and
# 11 bodies as the bounded walk, because what reaches a dispatch there already
# travelled for another reason. On `db` and `sqlite3` it is 45 bodies more out
# of 217, and the gate's wall time does not move. The one place the wide walk
# was expensive was a defect rather than a cost: it turned `ResultSet#read`
# into text, which read a `fun`'s enum as its base type and answered the
# `else` (`Iyi.fun_type`, fixed).
module Iyi::OpenTravel
  # Marks the written defs whose bodies have to travel.
  #
  # Run after semantic analysis and before an artifact is written, on the build
  # that has the typed bodies: the mark is read off a type's own `defs`, which
  # is what the artifact writers walk. A library def marked here is read by
  # nobody — an artifact writer asks only about the methods its own module
  # wrote — and its *callers* in the module are the answer this produces.
  #
  # `IYI_OPEN_TRAVEL=off` writes the boundary the way it was written before this
  # rule, and `=trace` prints the closure. The first is what
  # `bench/open_dispatch.sh` proves the defect with: a gate that cannot fail is
  # not a gate, and the failure here is a program that prints half a line.
