# iyi: the compiler's own regular expression engine.
#
# The compiler used to reach matching through Crystal's `Regex`, which links
# libpcre2-8. pcre2 sits on Crystal's required-libraries list and iyi means to
# need nothing on it, so matching is owned here. The guarantee recorded in
# SPEC.md III.10 and Appendix B decision 17 is RE2's: linear time always, no
# construct whose cost can grow with the subject.
#
# That guarantee is about cost, not about power, and the two were confused here
# once. RE2 refuses lookaround, so this engine did too, and the reason given was
# that lookaround needs a backtracker. It does not. A lookaround over a regular
# inner pattern is itself a regular property of a position, so it is answered by
# a pre-pass that costs one state set per character and nothing per position.
# Both senses of both directions are supported, nested to any depth, and
# lookbehind is not length-limited the way pcre2's is.
#
# What the trade actually costs is the constructs that are not regular:
# backreferences, recursion, subroutine calls and conditionals. Those are
# refused because no simulation answers them and no care makes them linear.
# Atomic groups and possessive quantifiers are refused for a different reason:
# they are controls for a backtracker, and there is none here to control. A
# capturing group inside an assertion is refused because the pre-pass never
# performs the sub-match that would set it, and reporting empty captures where
# pcre2 reports real ones is the kind of quiet difference this file exists to
# avoid.
#
# Four parts, one file:
#   1. Parser, pattern source to AST.
#   2. Compiler, AST to a Thompson NFA program.
#   3. Assertion pre-pass, one bitmap per assertion per subject.
#   4. Pike VM, runs the program while tracking capture slots.
#
# Match extents and captures agree with the pcre2 the compiler used to link, and
# `spec/compiler/iyi/rx_spec.cr` holds that agreement by running both engines
# over the same corpus, including exhaustive codepoint sweeps for the character
# classes. Agreement is with pcre2 as the stdlib builds it, PCRE2_UTF |
# PCRE2_UCP, so `\w` reads é as a word character and é|b is not a word boundary,
# because that is what every pattern the compiler used to run saw.
#
# Three places state a reading rather than inherit one, and all three are now
# narrow:
#
#   `\d` is any Unicode number, where pcre2 means \p{Nd} exactly, so ½ and Ⅴ
#   count here and do not there. No public stdlib predicate answers Nd on its
#   own: `Char#number?` is Nd plus Nl plus No, and everything finer is `:nodoc:`.
#   Shipping a case table to close one class is worse than saying this, so
#   `\p{Nd}` is refused rather than approximated.
#
#   `(?i)` folds through `Char#downcase(Unicode::CaseOptions::Fold)`, which is
#   simple case folding, the same relation pcre2 uses. It is exact for every
#   codepoint but one pair: ẞ full-folds to "ss", so the stdlib leaves it alone
#   and pcre2 pairs it with ß through simple case mapping. Chasing that one pair
#   with an extra downcase comparison opens others, because simple lowercase is
#   not symmetric.
#
#   Lookbehind follows the union law where pcre2 does not. `(?<=A|B)` holds
#   exactly where `(?<=A)` or `(?<=B)` holds; pcre2's unanchored search reports
#   a grouped mixed-length alternation as holding at positions its own anchored
#   evaluation denies. The spec pins pcre2's per-branch answers and never its
#   answer for the pair.
#
# Anything outside the supported subset raises `SyntaxError` when the pattern
# compiles; refusing loudly beats matching with quietly different semantics.

    # downcase, and the upcase of its fold, and each is kept only when it folds

    # simple upcase would pair ı (U+0131) with I and simple downcase would pair

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Part 4: lookaround assertions.
  #
  # `(?=L)`, `(?!L)`, `(?<=L)` and `(?<!L)` are not sub-matches here. A
  # lookaround over a regular inner pattern is itself a regular property of a
  # position, so it can be answered for every position of the subject at once,
  # in one pass, before the main match starts:
  #
  #   `(?<=L)` holds at i exactly when the text ending at i is in `Σ* L`. An NFA
  #   for L, seeded at every position so the `Σ*` needs no instructions of its
  #   own, run forward over the subject once, accepting at i, answers it for
  #   every i together. A variable length L costs the same as a fixed one, which
  #   is strictly more than pcre2 offers.
  #
  #   `(?=L)` holds at i exactly when the text starting at i is in `L Σ*`, which
  #   is the same statement read backwards: reverse L, seed at every position,
  #   run backward over the subject once.
  #
  # The negative forms share their positive form's bitmap and complement it at
  # the test site, so `(?!L)` builds no automaton of its own.
  #
  # Nesting works because an inner assertion's answer depends only on the
  # subject, never on the outer match: bitmaps are computed innermost first and
  # an inner one is already a finished table by the time the outer one runs. The
  # parser records an assertion only after parsing its body, which puts the
  # table in that order to begin with.
  #
  # Cost is one state set stepped per character per assertion, O(states) each,
  # so an assertion is O(1) amortised per input character. Running a sub-VM at
  # every start position, which is how a backtracking engine does this, is the
  # construction that would cost the linear-time guarantee (SPEC.md III.10).
