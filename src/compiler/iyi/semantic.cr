# The overall algorithm for semantic analysis of a program is:
# - top level: declare classes, modules, macros, defs and other top-level stuff
# - new methods: create `new` methods for every `initialize` method
# - type declarations: process type declarations like `@x : Int32`
# - check abstract defs: check that abstract defs are implemented
# - class_vars_initializers (ClassVarsInitializerVisitor): process initializers like `@@x = 1`
# - instance_vars_initializers (InstanceVarsInitializerVisitor): process initializers like `@x = 1`
# - main: process "main" code, calls and method bodies (the whole program).
# - cleanup: remove dead code and other simplifications
# - check recursive structs (RecursiveStructChecker): check that structs are not recursive (impossible to codegen)
