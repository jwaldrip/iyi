# iyi: definition-site typing — R-2c, the language rule the `check`
# probe grew up into.
#
# Lazy typing (inherited from Crystal) types a def when somebody calls
# it, so a build said "clean" about a body it never visited. R-2c closes
# that: every fully declared def in user code is typed at its
# definition, in the same compile as everything else — build, `check`,
# artifact emit and every LSP keystroke agree about what "clean" means.
#
# The probes are synthesized *after* the top-level pass, from resolved
# types, and that placement is load-bearing — a parse-time draft failed
# twice in ways worth keeping on record:
#
# - `def describe(e : Enumerable)` is fully written and still generic:
#   a trait_type restriction types per call (Crystal's own semantics), and
#   no parser can know which names are traits. Resolution first.
# - Probes visible to the top-level visitor met the macro expander
#   without a scope and crashed on the kemal port. Appended here, only
#   the main pass ever sees them.
#
# Mechanism: for each eligible def, a snippet at *global* scope — the
# resolved type names are absolute, so it types anywhere — calling it
# once with `uninitialized` values of the declared types, under
# `if false` so nothing can ever run. Instance methods get an
# `uninitialized Owner` receiver; module functions are called on the
# module itself. Every node is stamped with the def's own location, so
# a probe-found error anchors at the def it belongs to, and every
# synthesized call is marked so reference answers never count it.
#
# **Trait-restricted parameters get a witness.** `def total(s : Sized)`
# is generic, but the bound is written, and a bound is enough: the rule
# synthesizes one `struct IyiDefTypeWitnessN` per trait_type, implements the
# trait_type's abstract requirements with stub bodies, and probes the def
# with the witness — so a generic body calling anything *outside* its
# bound, or lying about its return, is caught at the definition. This
# is the half duck-typed generics never check and Rust checks
# always; here it costs one synthetic type per trait_type per compile.
#
# The probe calls from outside and may only reach what outside reaches
# — every fence below was earned by a failure, kept on record:
# non-`pub` module functions and non-`pub` types are behind R-2's wall
# (a spec's private `struct User`), impl-carried defs stay inside their
# trait_type context (R-3, the collections sample's `<=>`), `Program` is its
# own namespace so the nameable climb must stop there or hang, and
# witnesses are only built for simple traits — supertraits, generic and
# associated-type traits keep caller-typed bodies, stated rather than
# guessed at.
