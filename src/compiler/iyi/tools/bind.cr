# iyi: what it would take to put a Crystal shard behind an iyi boundary.
#
#   crystal tool bind -e Kemal shard_entry.cr
#
# R-2 asks every exported signature to write its types down, and Crystal infers
# instead of writing. Most of a shard's surface can be written down without a
# human: a method whose parameters carry types can be instantiated on purpose,
# and what it returns falls out of that. This says how much of a given shard is
# in that position, which is the number that decides whether a boundary is
# worth generating at all.
#
# It reads and counts; it writes no `.iyi` yet. Measuring first is the same
# order every other part of this project was built in.
#
# **It lives in the compiler rather than beside it**, and the reason is worth
# keeping: reading a shard means analysing the standard library it is written
# against, and the standard library asks `size_of`, which is answered from a
# data layout. A front end that links no LLVM has none, so a tool built that
# way cannot read a single real shard.
module Iyi
  # What a method is, for a boundary.
  enum BindVerdict
    # Every parameter and the return type are written. R-2 already.
    Ready
    # The parameters are written and the return type is not: a machine can
    # instantiate this and read the answer.
    NeedsReturn
    # A parameter carries no type. Nothing can guess it, so a human writes it.
    NeedsHuman
  end

  # What happened when a written return type was held against what a caller is
  # handed. III.6 rule 1 says the binding asserts and is not checked; this is
  # how much of that is still true, as a number rather than a sentence.
  enum BindCheck
    # Nothing was written, so there is nothing to check: what travels *is* what
    # instantiation answered, which is the half that was already checked.
    NotWritten
    # Written, instantiated, and the call answers what the restriction says.
    Agrees
    # Written, instantiated, and the call answers something else — `Int` where
    # a caller gets `Int32`, an abstract base where a factory hands back the
    # concrete class, a union with a member the method never produces. A
    # consumer told the written name is told something the symbol does not do.
    Disagrees
    # Written, and instantiation could not run. The restriction stands on the
    # shard's word, which is exactly what rule 1 describes.
    Unchecked
    # Abstract: there is no body to instantiate and no symbol of its own. The
    # declaration is the dispatch contract, and what a caller reaches is an
    # implementation — each of which is an ordinary method this tool checks as
    # itself. So this is not a return standing on the shard's word; it is one
    # carried by the methods underneath it, and counting it beside them said
    # the boundary was trusting something it had already verified.

  # is `*Greeter@Greeter::polite<String>:String` compiled from either language —
  # but only if the consumer's module *is* `Greeter`, and the consumer builds
  # that name by camelcasing the module path it imported. `downcase` broke the
  # round trip for every name with an inner capital: `MyGreeter` became
  # `mygreeter` became `Mygreeter`, which mangles to a symbol the shard's object
  # file does not contain, and nothing says so until the linker does.
  #
  # `::` is `/` because that is how iyi spells a nested module (IV.6 #6), and
  # each segment is `camelcase` run backwards.
  #
  # `String#underscore` is *not* that inverse and using it was the bug this
  # replaced: it answers `json` for `JSON`, which camelcases back to `Json`.
  # `camelcase` upper-cases the first letter of every underscore group, so its
  # inverse starts a group at every upper-case letter — `j_s_o_n`, which is a
  # legal iyi path and comes back `JSON`. `HTTPServer` is `h_t_t_p_server` and
  # comes back whole; `underscore` gave `http_server` and lost it.
