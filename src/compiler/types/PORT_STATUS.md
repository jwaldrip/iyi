# Port status of `src/compiler/iyi/types.cr`

Slice S1a. Every class, module, `def` and accessor declared in the hosted `types.cr` (4,014 lines), checked against the port: `src/compiler/types/*.iyi` and the base classes in `src/compiler/semantic/top_level.iyi`.

Generated mechanically by name and owner class (indentation-tracked, so a method is matched only to a class of the same name in the port). The status column is a name match: `ported` means the port declares the same member on a class of the same name at the given location, and it does not prove the values agree (the gate proves that). `other owner` means the port has a function of that name on a different owner, usually a module function taking the receiver as its first argument (the hosted code reopens classes, which iyi cannot do). `out of scope` marks Crystal-only printing and inspection, which the iyi port does not carry.

The `codegen reads` column comes from `src/compiler/lower/CONTRACT.md`: the number of readings by the Crystal code generator and the first reading. Those rows are the ones increment (2) must provide.

Totals: 568 rows. Increment (1) baseline: 141 ported, 107 other owner, 298 missing, 22 out of scope. Increment (2) provides the base `Type` members named in the `TypeQueries` rows below (`ported as TypeQueries.<name>`); the subclass overrides of the same names are not yet covered. 

Increment (9), regenerated from the status column: 186 ported, 98 other owner, 262 missing, 22 out of scope, 0 other. The rows changed in increment 9 are the members the type-model gate compares (semty_*.iyi, 260 operations); their status names the defining file.
Increment (3), `merge.iyi`, and increment (4), `filters.iyi` and `intersect.iyi`, are gated in `semty_merge.iyi`, `semty_filter.iyi` and `semty_intersect.iyi`. This session closed the divergences those fixtures used to list as "not gated": including_types (`ModuleType#including_types`, read by `TypeIntersect.including_descendent`), aliases (removed before intersecting, and union alias values merge through the hook), generic instances (`semty_generics.iyi`: an instance registers with its generic type, and a generic type stands for itself as a virtual type; `class IntBox < Box(Int32)` takes the instance as its superclass), procs (`TypeIntersect.compatible_proc?`, as the hosted `compatible_with?`, with `Void` returns converted to `Nil` by `TypeSystem.proc_of`), and union members printed devirtualized, as the hosted printer does. `SemanticProgram` resolves written types and merges through the `TypeHook` that `TypeSystem` installs. Typedefs (`remove_typedef`, lib declarations) are not declared by the port: the `# waiting typedef:` lines in `semty_alias.iyi` are reported by the gate under their own heading and are not compared. Increment (7): `restrictions.iyi` and `type_system.iyi` call `TypeIntersect.common_descendent`, and `filtering.iyi`'s copy is retired. Increment (5) is done in `lookup.iyi` (see below). Increments (6), (7), (8) and (9) are not started. Row counts above are the baseline; the status column was not regenerated.
Increment (5), the lookup port: `lookup.iyi` (`TypeLookup`), with `instances.iyi` (`TypeInstances`), the instance cache the lookup and the TypeSystem now share, since lookup.iyi cannot import type_system.iyi. The lookup covers `Path` (global, nested, the parent and namespace walk for the first item), `Union`, `Metaclass`, `Generic` (arity messages, splats of tuples and type parameters, `NamedTuple`, `Tuple`, `Union`, `Proc`, `Pointer`, `StaticArray` with a number size), `ProcNotation`, `Self`, and the nilable `?` (the parser writes it as `Union(T, Nil)`). Refused by name or not ported: `typeof`, `_`, a constant size, the import wall, `using`, private types, a type parameter solved through an inherited generic, and the parents of a generic instance. `TypeSystem.lookup_type_node` and `lookup_path` are deleted; `TypeSystem#resolve_node` is the one entry and the types driver's caller migrated to it. `SemanticProgram.lookup_type_node` keeps the simplified lookup: the real pipeline installs no TypeSystem, and routing that lookup through the hook broke the typing of its union branch, so only the superclass path uses the hook. `TypeRenderer` prints a union member devirtualized outside codegen, as the hosted printer does. The gate `semty_lookup.iyi`: 23 operations identical, the `typeof` operation is waiting, and three mutations are proved, among them the arity check and the unbound-generic check.
Increments (6), (7) and (8), the later status. This supersedes the typedef and "not started" sentences above. Restrictions: `to_restriction.iyi` (`TypeToRestriction`) ports `type_to_restriction.cr`, including the common-namespace rule for private types. `conversions.cr` needs typed calls and waits. Gate `semty_restrict.iyi`. Typedefs: `TypeDefType` and `LibType` in `top_level.iyi`, `Type#remove_typedef`, and the `LibDef` and `TypeDef` visits; lib functions, structs and external variables keep the default visit. Not ported: the lib's link annotations and call convention, `check_allowed_in_lib` (a typedef of a disallowed type is accepted), and the TypeDefType delegations (`pointer?`, `reference_like?`, `parents`, `defs`, `macros`, `lookup_instance_var`). `intersect.iyi`: `typedef_descendent`, with typedef operands on the right and a typedef's parent walk not ported. Includers: a generic instance records the modules its generic class includes (`GenericClassInstanceType#included_modules`, read by `subtype_of?` and `TypeIntersect.parents_of`, and registered with each `NonGenericModuleType#add_including_type`). Not ported: `GenericClassType#including_types`, which the hosted generic type answers with its instances (waiting in `semty_includers.iyi`). `AliasType#simple?` is always true, since every alias the port models names a type. Lookup: a private type reached at a later path item is refused as `private constant X referenced`. Gates `semty_restrict.iyi`, `semty_alias.iyi` and `semty_includers.iyi` are in `selfhost_semantic_types`, which now compares 12 fixtures over 241 operations.
